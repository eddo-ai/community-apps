"Zombie fires can burn under ice because of the trapped peat under the ice which serves as a burning source and fuel to keep a fire going. The reason why the peat is still there which is the fuel, is that 11,000 years ago the tilt of the earth had a larger angle of 24.8 degrees and because of the tilt being bigger the arctic used to be warm  and because of the energy from the sun the plants were able to grow and perform photosynthesis like in the tilt investigation lab we tested if the amount of light effects the photosynthesis and the one with the most light did the most photosynthesis which let out the most oxygen which turned the BTB blue which was our goal. The reason why peat is still there is because of the super cold temperature. And the reason why it is so cold now is because of the tilt angle shortening which made the arctic get a' lot less sun which made sure the peat would not decompose like in the yeast lab we tested if the temperature effected the amount of co2 was let out which is let out when something decomposes and the one who decomposed the most was the warm temperature. This relates to zombie fires because of the temperature it alows it to not decompose but when the fire burns it lets out more co2  which would melt the ice which would expose the peat to o2 and the more oxygen exposed makes the fire bigger overall letting out more carbion dioxide.","If the temperature of the earth begins to rise the permafrost in the arctic will melt which would expose it to more oxygen which would make the fires burn and get bigger making the atmospheres condition worse because of the carbon dioxide released from the fires  because of the burned plants from the photosynthesis 11,000 years ago because of the temperature change which made the peat to acts as fuel to burn which will overall make more fires",3,"To enhance your response, consider organizing your ideas more clearly into distinct sections.

"Originally, peat formed in the arctic because the tilt of the Earth was very different 11,000 years ago. 11,000 years ago, the tilt of the Earth was 24.5 degrees, meaning that the are recieved more solar radiation and energy from the Sun, which are vital inputs in the process of photosynthesis (Photosynthesis requiring CO2 (Carbon Dioxide) and H2O (Water) and Energy in order for a plant to make C6H12O6 (Sugar) and O2 (Oxygen)), meaning that the amount of plant life increased. Meanwhile, today, the tilt of the Earth is 22 degrees, meaning that there is much less photosynthesis occurring in the arctic today. So how does this peat still exist today? Well, for decomposition to occur, two things are needed: heat and oxygen. We know that heat is needed for decomposition to occur because in the yeast experiment, the warm beaker had 5 centimeters of foam after 20 minutes, while the cold one only had 0.4 centimeters of foam after the same amount of time, meaning that more carbon dioxide was emitted at a higher temperature through decomposition, as yeast is a decomposer. Because the peat is trapped underground under the permafrost, it is not recieving as much heat since it is directly under the permafrost, meaning that the cold from the permafrost transfers to the peat, so it ends up decomposing much less. Second, we know that oxygen affects decomposition because in the Oxygen and Decomposition sheet, the jar with no additional oxygen went from around 85% plant matter to around 60% plant matter after 125 days, while the jar with high additional oxygen went down from around 80% plant matter to only around 10% plant matter after the same amount of time. We know that matter cannot be created or destroyed, so less plant matter in the jar mmust mean that the plants were turned into gas (CO2) by the decomposers that were also put into these jars. This means that the decomposers converted more of the plant matter to carbon dioxide in the jars with more oxygen, meaning that more oxygen means a higher rate of decomposition. All in all, zombie fires can burn under the ice because as the fire burns throughout the season it is above ground, it begins to melt away the permafrost, allowing more oxygen to reach the peat that is stored under it, meaning that the fire both has access to more fuel and more oxygen, allowing it to continue the process of combustion (Requiring fuel (In this case, Peat), oxygen, and heat in order for something to burn.) underground safely.","If the temperature on Earth continues to rise, the amount of fires and CO2 will also increase because the increased temperatures will melt the permafrost, thus exposing the amount of peat and increasing the amount of peat that burns, meaning that we will have more and bigger fires. And as we know from the burning experiment, the peat produces the most carbon dioxide because when we burnt the peat, the BTB that turns from blue to green in the presence of carbon dioxide was most green in the container with the peat in it. So as all this peat burns, even more CO2 will be released into the atmosphere.",4,"To further improve your response, consider organizing your writing into clearer sections that address each part of the prompt explicitly. For instance, you could first explain how peat is formed and why it hasn't decomposed, and then detail how these factors contribute to zombie fires. This would make your argument more cohesive and easier to follow. Additionally, reinforcing the connection between the scientific concepts (like photosynthesis and decomposition) and the phenomenon of zombie fires would help deepen your analysis. Make sure to explicitly connect these ideas, using transitional phrases to guide the reader through your explanation.","You have done an excellent job of using specific evidence from class activities to support your claims about zombie fires. For example, your reference to the yeast experiment effectively demonstrates how heat affects decomposition, especially when you mention the warm beaker having 5 centimeters of foam compared to the cold one's 0.4 centimeters. This clearly illustrates the role of temperature in decomposition.

"there was enough matter in the system for the zombie fires to burn due to peat. 
11,000 years ago the earths tilt was 24.5 degrees. nowadays the earths tilt is 22 learned in the tilt model. the greater the earths tilt the more sun the arctic gets so 11,000 years ago the arctic got more sun and plants there could do a lot of photsynthisis. we know this becuase of our in-class lab where we compared the PSN making of three diferent plants in direct light, indirect light, and no light. after the lab we found out that direct light made the BTB the bluest therefore did the most PSN.  there is so much peat int he arctic becuase 11,000 years ago all the plants did a lot of PSN and when they died they did not decompose and then they turned into peat. the proper definition of peat is  ""a carbon based plant material made of long chains of glucose that had been under the permafrost and has not decomposed. the peat is under what is called permaforst which is permantent frozen soil. and the reason the peramost is causing the peat not to decompose yet is becuase in the yeast lab we learned that warm water caused the yeast to decompose the sugar the most and the cold water the least. so we know now that for the peat to decompse it needs to be in a  warm envierment but the permafrost is freezing so the peat cannot be decomposed. becuase the peat is a excellent fire burning substance learned in the burning fuels lab the peat gets burned by the fire all winter long and there is so much peat becuase of all the PSN that happened all those years ago and becuase the permafrost caused the peat to not decompose.

This is a valuable connection between solar radiation and the carbon cycle, and it's clear that you understand how these factors contribute to the presence of peat."
"There was enough matter and energy in the system for zombie fires to burn under ice because tons of peat was formed and there is still a lot of peat in the arctic.  So much peat formed in the arctic because the arctic was tilted towards the sun at the time, and when you are in a more direct path to the sun, lots of plants are going to grow because there is energy that comes from the sun.  In the lab we did where we see how much O2 is realeased from the plants depending on how much light it gets, we saw that the plants that were right under the light made the BTB turned bluer than the plants that had indirect light and the plants that had no light.  This shows that the plants that got more energy/sunlight go through photosynthesis better than plants that don't and 1000s of years ago the arctic got a lot of sunlight so plants were able to be grown and compressed into peat.  The reason that there is still a lot of peat in the arctic is because it can't decompose because of the permafrost surrounding it.  The lab we did with the yeast demonstrated this.  When things decompose, they represent the CO2 bubbles in the yeast.  When the water, which represented the surrounding area around the peat, was cold, there weren no CO2 bubbles (decomposition) at 10 minutes.   But when the water was warm, there was 5.1 cm of CO2 bubbles.  This shows why there is no decomposition in the peat because when the surrounding area is cold, there is no decomposition, and the permafrost makes the surrounding area cold.  This relates to zombie fires because now the fires can burn the peat under ground in the winter because there is so much of it from when the arctic was tilted towards the sun  that hasn't decomposed because the permafrost is stopping the process of decomposition.","If the temperature on earth continues to rise then it could either go two ways for zombie fires.  It could melt the permafrost and then the peat starts decomposing, or it could make it so more peat is created in the arctic so zomie fires have even more things to burn.  I think the second thing is going to happen because if plants in the arcti start growing more now that temperatures are rising, it won't even matter if the peat all ready there starts to decompose because new burnable things will be popping up constantly.",3,"While your response is thorough, consider organizing your ideas more clearly to enhance readability.

"zombie fires can burn under ice because of the peat under the permafrost. the peat under the perma frost dosent gets little to no oxygen under the permafrost. in the oxygen and decomposition worksheet it shows us that when there is no additional oxygen the decomposigtion process is slower it shows us on the graph that the starting point is 85% and ends at 60% while the high additional oxygen starts at 85% and ends at 5% this shows how the peat dosent decompose as fast under the permafrost and the peat is a main reason on how its still burning. 11,000 years ago the arctic was very different because of its tilt, the tilt of the earth was 24.5 degrees but now its 22.1 degrees. when there is a bigger tilt there is more solar radiation this means that there was more sun 11,000 years ago which shows how there wasnt any ice years ago so all of the dead plants woould go into the lakes and it would get frozen over. these both connect to zombie fires burning peat underground because it talks about how peat dosent decompose fast so zombie fires last long and it also talks about hwo the peat was formed and got there.",if the temperature on earth countinues to rise the peat will slowly secrease over thousands of years but the zombie fires will still go on for a long period of time.,2,"To improve your response, consider organizing your explanation more clearly to enhance the flow of ideas.

"Zombie fires have enough matter and energy in the system to burn under permafrost (ice) because of peat. Peat is made out of dead vegetation (plants). In the lab that we did with beakers, we used yeast to represent peat and the foam that was created as carbon dioxide. We used 3 beaker with different heats, they were warm, room temp., and cold. Now we put the same amount of everything in each, and it showed at the end of 12 minutes, that the 3rd beaker (the warm one) had around 4cm of foam (carbon dioxide) while the room temp. one had around 2cm of foam and the cold one had less than 1cm (0.7cm). Now how does this relate to the claim?, well peat is made of dead plants that decomposed. This is because of photosynthesis. Which is cause by the earth's tilt. Before this all happened the earth had a less of a tilt, causing more heat in Alaska. But now that the earth had a tilt between 22-23 degrees, it causes less heat Alaska. Now Alaska is super cold. Causing the decompisition process to be slower. This is why peat is still in Alaska. And because of this slow process, zombie fires have enough matter and energy from dead vegetation under the ice to keep the fire ignited releasing smoke (CO2) into the air, increasing the tempature in the air (also) to create more of the zombie fire. Making it larger in size.","If the tempature on Earth continues to rise, my prediction is that there would be more zombie fires. This is because our forests and places with lots of wood and grass are already flamible, then to add that there is probably lots of peat there, making the world have lots of fires.",2,"To enhance your response, consider organizing your explanation more clearly by starting with a concise claim that directly addresses the question. For example, you could begin with 'Zombie fires can burn under ice because peat provides both the matter and energy needed for combustion.' Following this, ensure that your evidence directly supports this claim. You mention the Earth's tilt and its influence on temperature, which is a complex idea; make sure to clarify how this connects back to the slow decomposition of peat and the resulting energy availability. Additionally, elaborate on how the presence of peat in Alaska contributes to zombie fires, focusing on the continuity and flow of energy and matter within the system. Connecting these ideas more explicitly will strengthen your argument and fulfill the assignment criteria more completely.","Your response effectively addresses the formation and persistence of peat in the Arctic, linking it to the concept of zombie fires.

Additionally, you included a detailed recount of the yeast/decomposition lab, which is a strong piece of evidence from our class activities. You noted that 'the 3rd beaker (the warm one) had around 4cm of foam (carbon dioxide) while the room temp. one had around 2cm of foam and the cold one had less than 1cm (0.7cm),' effectively showcasing how temperature impacts decomposition and carbon dioxide production."
"The zombie fires can burn under the ice because of the excesive amout of peat that is underneath the ice and permafrost. We saw that in our burning lab that peat had burned the longest compared to the wood and leaves. This shows that peat can carry on large scale fires for a very long time, and that it will also be able to keep that fire burning under ground in the winter because of the large amounts of enegry and sugar the peat has. When the peat burns it relases CO2 and H2O into the air, and it also melts the permafrost that has more peat underneath, allowing the fire to be able to spread even more. But what is peat made of? In the Peat, Permafrost, Carbon reading packet we see that peat is made out of compressed layers from dead plant matter usually underneath an open body of water. But how did all the peat not decompose? Since this peat forms under a body of water, the lack of oxygen will slow decompososition, but also the cold temperatures will affect this. We saw that in our decomposition investgation lab with the yeast that the warm temprature grew foam of about 3.2 cm in height. This foam represents decomposition since the yeast is eating the sugar and relases CO2, just like how other things break down matter and realse CO2. But when looking at the cold beaker, it only grew about 1cm of foam, much less than the warm temprature. From this lab we can see that the temprature of somthing can affect the decompostion rate. Since the artic is so cold, decomposistion will be slower, therefore peat will last longer. The lack of oxygen of were the peat is also affects this, we saw that in Oxygen and Decomposition that the plant matter with no additional oxygen had about 60% of its plant matter left. While the one with the most additional oxygen had about 15% left. This shows that the presence of oxygen can greatly affect the rate of decomposition. Since peat formed in a cold, low oxygen enviroment, it would have barely decomposed because of these conditions. But for peat to form how did thoose once alive plants even get there? We see that in the Geologic Time reading sheet that 11,000 years ago the earth was at a different tilt, of about 24.5 degrees, allowing more sun to shine on the artic. This is important because we saw that in our tilt investigation lab that the aquatic plants in the direct sunlight had gone through more photosynthesis since the BTB had changed from green to blue, meaning more oxygen was created, showing more photosynthesis happened. Then we saw the indirect light aquatic plant had barely changed, being a green blueish color showing that it had less photosynthesis than the direct sunlight plant. Then the one with no sunlight of course was a yellow green, showing no photosynthesis happened. This connects back to the 24.5 degree tilt because the Artic was getting more direct sunlight therefore allowing more photosynthesis to happen in plants, therefore allowing more plants to die and form peat. Then that peat was spared from decomposistion and had stayed under the permafrost not decomposing, allowing to be ignited by the fires and have fires survive under the ground.","If temperatures continue to rise on earth, there will be more zombie fires, and just fires in general, happening in the artic. Since the temperature is rising, more peat will be exposed, allowing fires to continue to spread as more peat is accsessable to them. Then the melting permafrost could also expose more zombie fires to reignite as then oxygen will be present and fanning the fire. But, if permafrost melts, that means peat will be in greater contact with oxygen, and as seen in our Oxygen and Decomposistion Sheet, the greater presence of oxygen there is, the faster decomposistion will happen. Fires may rage on for long periods of time in the artic, but eventually, the peat that fire burns will eventually decompose leaving it nothing to burn. The rising tempratures could also mean less snow and ice, so then fires won't have to burn underground and they can keep burining all the time. But if these fires then keep burning, they won't allow any new peat to form for them to burn. So eventually, after a very long time, the fires would eventually stop since all the peat will either be burned to ash or would have decomposed because of the oxygen now present all around them.

"first of i want to adress what is inder the perma frost. peat is under the perma frost and burnes(the zombie fire). the reson the peat is able to burn under the permafrost is because it is made of dead plants. and dead plants are made of O2+C6+H12.and the dead plants are made 11000 years ago. the peat contains energy wich fuels and gives it the ability  to make the fire under the permafrost.and during the time when heat is available the fires are able to increase due to decompsion.CO2 is a sighn of decomposure and itt increases in the heat because things need heat to decompose.and the smoke of the fire contains CO2.and there continues to be more permafrost due to the earths tilt.the heat in the artic differs due to earths tilt,it can either increase the heat or lessen it so it can change the outcome of decomposure.that is why it was different a thousand years ago than it was today","
i predict that the fires will increase due to the temprature changes that continue to apply to the artics ecosystem. and the burn scars will continue to get bigger over time causing the size of the fires to get bigger.and if any fire is exsposed to a higher temrature it will increase. so this will do the same for the zombie fire. and if the tempratue increases so will decomposure and so will dead plants and so will the peat and then so will the fire. because the peat fuels the fire.",2,"To improve your response, focus on organizing your ideas more clearly and concisely.

"zombie fires can burn under ice because there is so much matter and carbon in the peat that it will keep burning but at a very slow flamelss level.that is until it will flame back up again in the spring when everything is dry again creatign fires that spread fast and for far distances. it was able to stay a fire becuase of how warm and compacted the peat was allowing a fire to stay alive but not lit and this peat was compacted with thousands of little tree needles which were dead making it a very flamble matter . in the artic there is thoudands of pounds of peat.and peat is burning in the artic for ever but how is it bruning and how is there so much carbon and matter in the peat that allows it to burn in th ecoldest place on earth including how did so much of it get there?well 11,000 years ago the aerth was tilted 24.5 but what does this have yot do with the artic well it gives more solar radition towards the artice meaning that it was much hotter there , with plant and without snow. so less sun eqauls less plants and more snow. but more sun eqealus more plants and less snow. so 11,000 years ago there used to be plants and peat!which when the earth shifted the artic became the artic killing all trees allowing for peat to be store dunderneaththe snow. but how is peat made when photosynthisis happens . photosynthis is when green plants use the sun,water,and oxygen to create glucose and sugar for other plants also edmitting corban dieoxide. this is how  has ended up in the artic and why theres so much of it. without peat and energy zombie fires cant happen. the peat allows for fires to restart in the spring when all is warm again and how they go back down to a very flamelss fire in the winter. when we burnedm the peat in class it burned for 6 hours capared to the leave that was 60 secodns and the stick that was 5 minutes. this shows how long a small peaie of peat can burn for. also the tilt of the aerth affected peat in the artic making it alll start to burn and realsie co2 .

Additionally, it would be beneficial to clarify the connection between the Earth's tilt and the presence of peat in the Arctic. Your explanation mentions '11,000 years ago the earth was tilted 24.5,' but it would be helpful to expand on how that tilt specifically contributed to the conditions that allowed peat to accumulate. Lastly, ensure you check for spelling and grammar errors, such as 'flamble' instead of 'flammable' and 'corban dieoxide' instead of 'carbon dioxide,' to improve the readability and professionalism of your writing.","You have shown a good understanding of the concept of zombie fires and how they can continue to burn under ice. Your explanation about the role of peat is quite thorough, especially when you mention that 'there is so much matter and carbon in the peat that it will keep burning but at a very slow flameless level.' Additionally, you incorporated a nice piece of evidence from class activities: 'when we burned the peat in class it burned for 6 hours compared to the leave that was 60 seconds and the stick that was 5 minutes,' which provides a concrete example of the longevity of peat as a fuel source. This is a strong use of evidence from class to support your understanding."
"Zombie fires can burn in ice because, in the Artic the peat in under the permafrost, and peat is frozen matter and energy in the solid, when the permafrost starts to melt then the increase of tempreture occurs, and fire starts to begin, the fire then causes combuston and releases smoke into the air, the matter is then transformed into carbon CO2 and H2O. The dead plants that were layered inot peat had sugar in them which were made 11,000 years ago through Photosynthesis, and that then caused the increase in oxygen, causing fire to burn longer, and then a larger fire equaled to more CO2, and since the permafrost would be more melted due to the peat starting fire, it will release the energy into the air. In our yeast lab, it showed an example of peat, like how if the permafrost was frozen and cold, peat would be trapped under the permafrost and will not decompose and there is no CO2, in room tempreture, zombiefires cause the permafrost to start melting and the tempreture increases, that would casue the peat to start decomposing, and a little CO2 releases, In warm, the zombie fires keep burning, the permafrost will keep melting and more CO2. Whixh shows how the yeast lab connects with the zombie fires. In the past, the artic was different than today because, 11,000 years ago the tilt of the earth was 24.8, which had a larger angle of tilt that menat more sunlight in the Artic, while now the tilit is 22.1 and the angle is less tilted which doesn't habe much sunlight. In our tilt lab invertigation we saw how in the direct sunlight the BTB turned blue, it had a high amount of O2 and high amount of photosynthesis, while the indirect sunlight was getting llittle O2 and no photosynthesis and very little color chnage, lastly the beaker that was getting no sunlight had no chnage color and lots of CO2 but no PSN.","If the Earth's temperature starts to rise then there wll be lots of solar radition occuring in our lives, but tons of dehydration because of the heat, therer will be PSN occuring becasue there will be more heat meaning more sun to the Earth's atmosphere. Lastly there will be a lot of energy forming, as it generates heat and brekaing down chemical bonds.",2,"To improve your response, consider breaking down your ideas into shorter, more focused paragraphs to enhance clarity. For instance, you could have a separate paragraph discussing the formation and characteristics of peat, followed by another paragraph on how these contribute to zombie fires. Also, make sure to include direct evidence from the 'Burning fuel samples demonstration' to further strengthen your explanation of energy flow through the zombie fire system. Additionally, when discussing the future impacts, it would be beneficial to explicitly state your prediction based on rising temperatures and draw more connections to the class activities, such as how increased CO2 from fires might affect global temperatures.","You've done a great job of explaining how peat is trapped under the permafrost and how it contributes to zombie fires. Your description of the process where 'the permafrost starts to melt then the increase of temperature occurs, and fire starts to begin' clearly shows your understanding of the conditions required for zombie fires. Additionally, your mention of the 'yeast lab' as an example to explain the decomposition process of peat and its relation to CO2 release demonstrates a thoughtful use of class activities to support your explanation. Furthermore, you effectively connected past conditions in the Arctic with today's changes by explaining how the Earth's tilt affects sunlight exposure, which is a solid application of the 'Elodea/Earth’s Tilt lab' findings."
"Peat was frozen under the permafrost keeping matter and energy in tact. But once the permafrost melts, the peat is exposed to oxygen. An increase in oxygen causes the fire to get bigger which results in carbon dioxide to get released. Once co2 gets released (smoke) it causes energy to be released as well. An example of this is the yeast lab we did in class. When the first beaker had tap water (cold), it resembled the permafrost being cold and frozen. Peat was trapped under the permafrost and couldn't decompose. The room temp beaker resembled zombie fires causing the permafrost to start melting and temperatures increase. This causes the peat to start decomposing. And lastly, the warm beaker, if the zombie fires kept burning, the permafrost will keep melting and more co2 will be released. ","if the temperature on earth continues to rise, then the fires will increase. I say this because earth can only handle so much heat, and if we get to much of it, it wouldn't be safe to leave your house or anything of that matter. If this did happen, everyone will benefit from it, but not in a good way, there will be so many sacrifices us humans will have to make. Everywhere you look, it would be a burn scar just waitting to take place or have already happened. I would say that kids would benefit from it the most because just think, kids are being born everyday at every second, imagine having to grow up not being able to do what you would want to do. You can't really play outside, can't go to school, and more. ",2,"To improve your response, consider organizing your explanation more clearly by explicitly stating your claim at the beginning. For example, you could start with ""Zombie fires can burn under ice because..."" followed by your detailed explanation. Additionally, make sure to incorporate more specific evidence from class activities. While you referenced the yeast lab, strengthening your explanation with details from other activities, such as the burning fuel samples or Elodea lab, could reinforce your claim. Finally, make connections to multiple scientific ideas, such as the carbon cycle or decomposition, to deepen your explanation and fulfill more of the assignment criteria.","You did a great job of articulating the process of how peat is preserved and then exposed to oxygen, which is a critical concept for understanding zombie fires. Your statement, ""Peat was frozen under the permafrost keeping matter and energy intact. But once the permafrost melts, the peat is exposed to oxygen,"" clearly describes the transformation process that occurs as the environment changes. This shows a good understanding of the relationship between temperature changes and the release of carbon dioxide, which is important for explaining the zombie fire phenomenon."
"Zombie fires can burn under the ice because of the amount of peat that's formed in the Arctic. The Earths tilt used to be in favor of giving the Arctic solar energy 11,000 years ago.  This means there was more photosynthesis giving to plants, letting them release oxygen. In todays time the Earth has tilted from 24.5 degrees to 22.1 degrees, changing the direction of the solar energy that the Arctic gets. These plants from 11,000 years ago has turned into peat. Peat is formed from dead plants. The peat gives the fire enough energy to be maintained and stay alive because peat is a source that can be burned for a long time. Basically the fuel for the fire. The reason the peat doesn't decompose is because of the water and cold conditions isn't giving peat the oxygen it needs. Preventing the peat from decomposing. The Zombie fires feed off of organic matter found in peat. Since the fires are sill burning the tempatures increase, when the tempatures increase the permafrost melts. The permafrost gets exposed to oxygen , which causes the fire to ignite and and get bigger, causing more co2 released into the air. ","If the tempatures on Earth continues to rise the zombie fires will ignite and get bigger. and it may effect our air becuase there would be more co2. If there was a temp increase, more permafrost would melt exposing the fire to o2. This would make the fire bigger. When fire burns it releases co2, especailly if the fire gets bigger that means even nmore co2 would be released. Which could affect us humans. ",1,"To enhance your explanation, consider organizing your response to more clearly follow the assignment structure. For instance, explicitly stating how each scientific idea connects to your claim about zombie fires could strengthen your argument. You might want to elaborate on how the evidence from class activities, such as the 'Burning fuel samples demonstration' or the 'Yeast/Decomposition Lab,' supports your claims about energy flow and matter transformation. Adding specific data or observations from these activities would strengthen your evidence. Additionally, try to connect the process of cellular respiration more explicitly to your explanation of how energy flows into and out of the zombie fire system.","You've done a great job explaining how zombie fires can burn under ice by highlighting that 'Zombie fires can burn under the ice because of the amount of peat that's formed in the Arctic.' This shows a good understanding of the importance of peat as a fuel source. Additionally, you mention the role of Earth's tilt and historical photosynthesis in the formation of peat, which demonstrates a nice connection to multiple disciplinary ideas such as solar radiation and photosynthesis."
"There is enought matter and energy in the system because there is an large amount of peat that sustains the fires. Under the ice the zombie fires are burning peat. Peat has a lot of stored energy that the fires are ""feeding"" on. The fires are using the stored up matter and energy in peat to burn. There is so much peat because 11,000 years ago when the earth's tilt was 24.5 degrees the sun was shining directly on the artic. This means that the plants were able to grow in the artic and photosynthesis (the proccess in which plants take energy [light], CO2 and water and convert it into sugar [food for the plant] and oxygen) could occur. There was more plants in the artic 11,000 years ago because as we learned in the earth' s tilt lab that when the sun is diretly shining on the artic more photosynthesis occured. In the earth's tilt lab there were three beakers beaker A (direct sunlight beaker), beaker B (indirect light beaker), beaker C (control. All of the beakers had BTB in them. The BTB was green/yellow which mean that there was a lot of CO2, when oxygen is added to BTB it turns blue and if photosysnthesis is happening then the beaker will turn blue. At the end of the experitment beaker A had the bluest BTB, beaker A being the one the represented the artic 11,000 years ago. Beaker B had a greenish slightly blue BTB and beaker B represented the earth's tilt today.  Meaning that 11,000 years ago a lot of photosynthesis occured in the artic meaning that there were more plants then than now. More sunlight means more photosynthesis which in turn means more plants which eventually leads to more peat. Peat is made out of plants and peat takes hundreds to thousands of years to form. So the plants that were in the artic 11,000 years ago are now the plants that make up peat, a lot of plants back then means a lot of peat now and a lot of fuel for the fires. The reason why there is still so much peat though because it is too cold in the artic of the peat to decompose. The peat is under permafrost which is extreamly cold. When we did the yeast model we saw that the beaker with the least amout of heat was also the beaker with the least amount of bubbles created. In the yeast model we were looking at decompostion so the more bubbles that formed meant the more decompostition that occured. Now the beaker with the most bubbles was the warmest beaker and after 20 minutes 6cm of bubbles had formed. The beaker with the 2nd most bubles was the beaker with room temp. water and after 20 minutes 1cm of bubbles formed as signficatly less amount than the warmest beaker. Finally the beaker with the least amount of bubbles created was the coldest beaker and after 20 minutes only 0.7 cm of bubbles formed. This relates to the peat because the artic is so cold that not much or no decompostion will occur. The oxygen and decompostion model also explains why there is still so much peat. In this experiment there were four beakers, beakers A, B, C, and D. All of these beakers but beaker A were hooked up to an oxygen pump. So beaker A contained no additional oxygen, beaker B contained low amounts of additional oxygen, Beaker C contained and medium amount of additional oxygen and finally beaker D contained a hight amount of oxygen. In all of these beakers there was plant matter. At the end of the experiment the plant matter in beaker A had decomposed the least and the plant matter in  beaker D had decomposed the most. Beaker B had the 2nd least amount of decompostion and beaker C had the 2nd most amount of decompostion that occured.  This means that after thousands of years there can still be so much peat because in the artic is so cold and underground, under the permafrost there is a very small amount of oxygen. This is all related to zombie fires and the zombie fire system because during the winter the zombie fires burn the peat. In the burning fuel samples lab we learned that peat can burn for an extreamly long time and since there is so much peat the fires are able to surive all winter long on the peat. That is why there is enought matter and energy in the system for zombie fires to burn under ice. ","If the temperatures on Earth continue to rise the the zombie fires will get larger because the permaforst will melt. When the permafrost melts it exposes the peat to oxygen and as we know oxygen help fires to grow which will mean that the zombie fires will get larger. When the peat is being burned all of the storied carbon is being relased into a different form of matter, a gas, this gas being carbondioxide (CO2). CO2 is a greenhouse gas and greenhouse gases cause the earth's climate to rise even more because the trap heat in the atomosphere. If the temperatures contiue to rise the fires will continue to rage. Everything about this system is interconnected so if one thing rises everything rises. As the cycle conintues things will only get worse, there will only be more fires and more temperture increases if the cycle lives on. That is what will happen in the future if the temperatures continue to rise. ",4,"To enhance the organization and clarity of your writing, consider breaking down your response into paragraphs, each focusing on a specific aspect such as the formation of peat, its decomposition, and how these contribute to zombie fires. This will help the reader follow your argument more easily. Moreover, explicitly stating how each piece of evidence supports your claim can strengthen your explanation. For example, after discussing the yeast model, you might add a sentence explicitly linking the findings to how the cold Arctic environment preserves peat. Also, ensure you answer all parts of the question directly, especially the initial claim about how energy flows into and out of the system, as this will address the task criteria more comprehensively.","You've done a remarkable job in drawing connections between the class activities and the topic of zombie fires. Your explanation of how peat was formed, especially by referencing the Earth's tilt lab with details like 'when the sun is directly shining on the arctic more photosynthesis occurred,' is a strong point. Additionally, your thorough explanation of the yeast model and the decomposition lab, where you relate temperature and oxygen levels to peat decomposition, effectively supports your claim about the persistence of peat, contributing to the ongoing zombie fires."
"Zombie fires can burn under the ice because Peat is made up of Dead plants which are full of sugar and energy which allows fire to burn. In the tilt investigation We found out that with more solar radiation ther will be more photosythesis so there will be more energy in the plants. In the test tube directly under the light the btb changed back to blue showing it had the most photsynthesis/energy and the one in aluminium foil the btb stayed green so it had the leat photsythesis. And Since we know that thousands of years ago the artic was facing more to the sun because the tilt was greater. So Lots of plants grew in the arctic and the plants had lots of solar radiation and energy in them. And over the thousands of years when the tilt decreased and the arctic was farther from the sun the energy was stored in the plants and didnt decompose So all the Peat/energy was stored up which allowed the fires to burn under the ice. Also In the yeast lab The beaker with the warmest water created the most C02 with about 3 cm of yeast bubbles, and the one with cold water created no C02. This Shows that In colder temperatures like the arctic no decompostion is able to happen because of the cold temperature so all the dead plants just stays under the permafrost, So there is lots of dead plants for the fires to burn off under the ice.","If the temperature on Earth continues to rise lots of CO2 emissions will be released into the air. I think this will be the outcome because Peat is made up of dead plants that have not decomposed because of the cold temperature and little oxygen Because it is covered by a layer of frozen ground called permafrost. If temperature continue to rise over the years the arctic will get hotter so the permafrost will start to melt which will uncover the peat allowing get much more oxygen, sun exsposure and the temperature will rise. These factors will allow for all the peat to start to decompose which will release all the C02 stored inside it in to the air. Also for the Peat that is burning Under the Ice the fire will have more oxygen to burn off and all the C02 will be released from the peat.",3,"To improve your response, focus on organizing your explanation more clearly. Start by making a clear claim about how zombie fires can burn under ice, then systematically explain your evidence. You could structure it by first discussing the formation of peat and its composition, followed by how conditions in the past (like the greater tilt you mentioned) contributed to the high energy content in plants. Then, transition to how the cold temperatures prevented decomposition, as you noted in the yeast lab activity. This will help you to make a more concise and cohesive argument. Also, ensure your writing is legible and concise by reviewing spelling errors such as ""photsythesis"" and ""decompostion."" Lastly, make sure you tie back your evidence to your claim explicitly throughout your explanation to meet all the assignment criteria.","Your response effectively uses evidence from class activities to support your claim about how zombie fires can burn under ice. For example, you referenced the tilt investigation and the yeast lab, which demonstrates your understanding of the processes involved. You mentioned, ""In the tilt investigation We found out that with more solar radiation ther will be more photosythesis so there will be more energy in the plants,"" which shows your connection of solar radiation to energy availability. This is a strong application of scientific ideas to explain the matter and energy in the zombie fire system."
"In able for a zombie fire to burn under ice there has to be enough energy and matter. Zombie fires are just like peat. With peat being under the permafrost it means the matter/energy is frozen solid. There is glucose (C6H12O6) underground producing energy, matter, and O2 to be an output later on, causing zombie fires to burn under ice. When the permafrost melts, peat is now exposed to O2 and when there is an increase of O2, fires form and get bigger. CO2 and H2o is also an output from the fires. With the sketches shown in class we see how everything first starts as being in input and see what the outputs are.  As a class we did a yest project using cold, room temp., and warm H2o. The cold beaker stayed with no O2 and H2o through the whole 12 minutes, but comapre to the warm beaker there was an output of O2 and H2o. At the 12th minute the O2 and H2o was at 4 cm. What helped the bubbles grow was glucose (C6H12O6) just how the zombie fires are formed and the glucose being in imput of starting a zombie fire burning under ice. Besides the glucose 11,000 years ago the artic was warmer then now due to the tilt. Because it was warmer ice could of melted faster meaning there could of been more zombie fires make then compare to now. The artic back then was warmer meaning the tilt was greater and had more solar energy that reached the artic which is shown in the earths tilt sketch. ",If there is an increase in global temperatures it will cause the permafrost to melt due to the weather/inputs from nature it normally hasn't been getting the past years with colder temperatures. Zombie fires could then also form and possiably get bigger effecting the surrondings in the habitat it happens which will most likely be the artic.  Not only the nature but it will hurt our own global warming.,1,"To enhance your explanation, consider organizing your response more clearly by using the sentence starters you have been given. For instance, you could start by clearly defining what peat is and how it forms in the Arctic. This will provide a strong foundation for your explanation of why it doesn't decompose under permafrost conditions. Additionally, try to more explicitly link your evidence from the class activities to your claims about the zombie fires. For example, you mention 'the yeast project using cold, room temp., and warm H2O'—try to make a clearer connection between this experiment and the real-world scenario of zombie fires by explaining more about what this tells us about decomposition and energy flow. Also, further explain your point about the Earth's tilt and how this historical context impacts current and future conditions for zombie fires.","You have done a great job of discussing the role of glucose (C6H12O6) in the zombie fire system, specifically how it contributes to energy production. Your explanation about how 'when the permafrost melts, peat is now exposed to O2 and when there is an increase of O2, fires form and get bigger' clearly connects the concept of decomposition and combustion to the phenomenon of zombie fires. It's clear that you have engaged with the class activities, particularly the yeast project, and used it effectively to illustrate how energy and matter processes work in colder and warmer environments, which is a nice connection to the class experiments."
"Peat is formed by dead/Decopesed plants over time thats died 11,000 years ago and they decomposed at a very slow timel. 11,000 years ago the earths tilt was 25.5. And that means that the greater the tilt the greater the solar radiation meaning that 11,000 years ago ther were way more plants growing because of all the radiation. That means that the plants were doing a lot of photosysthisis. Photosynthisis is when plants make thier own food by energy(light)+ CO2+water--->O2+C6H12O6(sugar) . Now theres a lot a peat still burning under the permaforst because umm in our lab peat took a really long time to burn and maybey because there was more solar radiationa dn then that means more PSN  so more like plants and stuff are growing so ther more plants over all meaning more peat and the peat clould still be burning under there. and the plants had stored sugar in them so like thats energy and that kinda like shows how there is energy in peat so its burning and ",if the tempature get warmer the permafrost is gonna melt and when  the permafrost melts its gonna cause zombie fires to get bigger and then more CO2 will be created so i think that this means in the future the co2 could like cause more fires aroung the world or like make the air that we are breathing around us bad for us.. and more co2 will be created beecause there is more fires and fire makes smoke which is co2,2,"To improve, try to organize your thoughts more clearly and connect them directly to the criteria provided. First, ensure that you clearly state your claim about how zombie fires can burn under ice. Use the sentence starter ""Zombie fires can burn under ice because..."" to introduce your main idea.

"There was enough matter and energy in the zombie fire system for two main reasons. The first one has to do with the Earth's tilt. In the Geologic TIme article that we read in class we learned that the earths orbital tilt (the same thing that gives us different seasons) has not always been the same 22.1 degrees that it is today and was closer to 24.5 degrees over 11,000 years ago. Addintioanlly,  in the earth's tilt actvity in class where we changened the amount of light the same kind of plants inside a BTB solution and we learned that the more light a plant got the more oxygen and glucose it would produce (also know as photosynthesis which shows that the plant is growing), we know this because the BTB had changed color from the dark green to a dark blue in the one with the most light exposure while the one with non direct lgiht only changed from dark green to light green. This confirms that photosynthisis took place. Linking these two toggether we can conclude that 11,000 years ago, when the earths tilt was a more aggresive 24.5 degrees, that this would give plants more light from the sun because of being in more dirrect light exposure. This would cause more growth. Then, as time goes on and the earths tilt becomes less and less, those same plants that where in semi warm conditions and got lots of sun exposure would be in the much colder areas with less sun exposure. This leads me right up to me second reason. In the yeast lab expirment we mixed  yeast and sugar into different temperature water to see the affect. Our findings where that the yeast decompused more when it was in warmer water. One pice of evidense from this lab is at 10 minutes, the warm beaker had 13 cm of foam while the cold one had 0cm. This shows how the colder temperatures slow down the rate at which things are decomposed. Sinse the plant matter from before is in a colder place it can not be decompused and keeps its energy, it has now turned into peat. This all relates to Zombie Fires as Peat is there main fuel source and since it is trapped under the perma frost from the colder climate, the fires are able to continue to burn under ground and re-amerage in the spring when the snow melts.","If the global temperature continuse to rise with global warming, there will be a decrease in zombie fires as the Perma Frost that used to keep the Peat from decomposing melts and the Peat's energy breaks down. Thus getting rid of the zombie fires source of fuel.",3,"To improve your response, consider organizing your thoughts more clearly to directly address the task criteria. Start by clearly stating your claim about matter and energy in the zombie fire system and how it relates to peat formation and decomposition. You could begin with a direct statement like, ""Zombie fires can burn under ice because of the presence of peat, which formed due to historical changes in Earth's tilt leading to increased plant growth, and the lack of decomposition due to colder temperatures."" Then, clearly separate the discussion of the Earth's tilt and the yeast lab to show how each piece of evidence supports your claim. Ensure you connect these pieces back to how they enable the zombie fire to burn. Consider using transitions to guide the reader through your argument more clearly. Finally, make sure to check for typos and improve the clarity of your writing by breaking down longer sentences and ensuring your point is concise and directly tied to your evidence.","You've done a great job in using specific evidence from class activities to support your claims. For instance, you referenced the Earth's tilt activity by explaining how changes in the Earth's tilt led to increased sunlight and plant growth: ""the more light a plant got the more oxygen and glucose it would produce (also known as photosynthesis)"". This clearly ties into your understanding of photosynthesis and how it contributed to plant growth in the past, which is a crucial part of the formation of peat. Additionally, your reference to the yeast lab experiment is strong; you provided concrete data, such as ""at 10 minutes, the warm beaker had 13 cm of foam while the cold one had 0cm,"" to explain how colder temperatures slow decomposition."
"In the past, the arctic was different than today because scientists found that the permafrost was formed about 11000 years ago from living plants that died and are going though the process of decomposition still today. earths tilt also lessened because before the tilt was 24.5 degrees and the angle now is 22.1. This affects the permafrost because with the earths stilt being greater, theres more sun on the arctic, and with less it means less sun. Under the permafrost in the arctic there is peat. Peat is made of glucose and plants that died and started to decompose. Plants also perform what is called photosynthesis which is a process where they take in glucose and energy from the sun and releases oxygen and CO2. We know it needs light because in our tilt investiagtion we concluded that the jar we used with a plant and BCB in it having the most light increased the photosynthesis changing the BTB to blue. Peat is formed when organic matter is dead and broken down. This process takes place in a body of water where plants die and fall into the water beginning this process. The reason peat is still being formed under the permafrost is because there is a lack of oxygen and heat for it to decompose. We know matter needs oxygen and heat to decompose because in our oxygen and decomposition experiment, there were 4 jars filled with plant matter and decomposers such as mold,bacteria,and maggots. They gave each jar a different oxygen level. Jar A had no additional oxygen while jars B,C,and D had low, medium, and high levels of oxygen. The jar with the highest amount of oxygen decomposed the fastest and therefore showing us that high amounts of oxygen are best to have matter decompose at a normal pace. Now, we know that the artic has low amounts of oxygen under the permafrost since theres still peat decomposing from 11000 years ago. Although this is true, its not the only reason peat is still there. Peat is able to burn for very long amounts of time because we tested this to be true in our burning fuels investigation. During that investigation, we burned leaves, sticks, and peat. They all started with the same amount of grams, and once burned they all lost almost the same amount of grams, however, the peat was capable of burning for 6 hours which was much more than the stick and leaves. Since there is so much peat under the permafrost, that also means that theres over ten times the amount we tested in the lab. So, zombie fires can burn under the ice because when fire burns heat increases, which causes the permafrost to melt and when it does, the peat is exposed to oxygen which increases the fire to get bigger and a bigger fire means more CO2 being released and that helps the decomposition so the fire will last longer especially when heat is rising and peat is decomposing. This releases more CO2 into the atmosphere.","If temperature on Earth continues to rise, the artic will start to melt and the zombie fires will probably increase or last longer because of the rise in temperature. The zombie fires will also need less effort to be able to burn longer and through the arctic. We know this because with our experiments we concluded that warmer temperatures causes the artic to melt thus having the peat underneath the permafrost to take in more oxygen and warmth to be able to decompose. If zombie fires keep burning, the permafrost will continue to melt, then releasing more CO2. It will also help peat decompose because of the increase in temperature which we know is one of the things matter needs to decompose.",3,"To improve your response, consider organizing your explanation in a clearer sequence that directly addresses the task criteria. Start by explicitly stating your claim about how zombie fires can burn under ice, then follow with a structured explanation of how peat is formed and why it hasn't decomposed, using subheadings or transitional phrases. This will help guide the reader through your reasoning. Additionally, make sure to clarify the connections between the scientific concepts discussed, like photosynthesis and decomposition, and their relevance to the phenomenon of zombie fires. This will enhance the clarity and coherence of your argument.","Your response clearly demonstrates a thorough understanding of the processes at play in the formation and persistence of zombie fires. You successfully incorporate evidence from multiple class activities, such as the burning fuels investigation and the oxygen and decomposition experiment, to support your claims. For example, you effectively explain that ""the jar with the highest amount of oxygen decomposed the fastest,"" which ties into how the lack of oxygen under the permafrost contributes to the persistence of peat. Additionally, your discussion about the impact of Earth's tilt on the amount of sunlight received in the Arctic is insightful and shows a good grasp of how environmental factors affect permafrost and peat formation."
"Peat is made out of dead plant organisms, which are sugar-containing carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. Peat is formed by thousands of years of plants dying, more specifically, when dead plants organisms end up in an open body of water, like a lake, forming a dense layer at the bottom. From our decomposition investigation, this action is known as decomposition, that uses the process of cullular respiration, this process can release a lot of carbon dioxide into the air, which allows the zombie fires to burn, more oxygen available makes more carbon dioxide, and as the fires burning also increases the temperature which releases even more carbon dioxide. So the zombie fires have almost unlimited fuel.

Zombie fires are able to burn under ice because there is peat trapped uner the ice that provides the fire with matter/energy, that allows the zombie fire to burn for an astonishing time. The zombie fire investigation shows when fire burns, temperature increases, when temperature increases, permafrost melts and the peat is exposed to oxygen, an increase in oxygen cause the zombie fires to grow bigger, and when the fire is bigger, more carbon dioxide is released for the fire to burn off of. 

The arctic in the past was very different than it is today, and the Tilt Model shows explains the huge difference. 11,000 years ago, the earth had a much larger tilt, letting in more solar energy that reaches arctic, higher solar radiation means more photosynthesis, that allows plants to grow. Present day, the arctic is cold and there is peat frozen in permafrost with no decomposition occuring. That is because the earth's tilt is much less than it was 11,000 years ago, letting less solar radiation reach the arctic, and less sun means less plants. 

Overall, there is a vast amount of energy the zombie fires are able to burn off of to cointinue buriing through winter, based of the decomposition from yeast, that is a living decomposer  that breaks down glucose, that creates energy from cullular respiration. ","If the temperature on earth continues to rise, that would leave the arctic back to are close to how it was 11,000 years ago. The Earth's Tilt lab presented the effects of what happens when solar energy reaches the arctic, plants would be able to regrow based off the melting of the permafrost where the process of photosynthesis will take place. Although the heat is coming from the earth internally, the peat would still be able to combust through the permafrost and snow, and the zombie fires would continue to burn from the huge amount of energy still being produced by decomposition.

For instance, start with a clear statement like 'Zombie fires can burn under ice because...' and then expand on it with the evidence you've gathered. Additionally, try to make a more direct connection between the scientific processes you mention (photosynthesis, cellular respiration, decomposition) and how they specifically contribute to the phenomenon of zombie fires. When discussing evidence from class, such as the Tilt Model, ensure you tie it back to how the historical context impacts the current state of zombie fires. This will help strengthen the connection between your evidence and your claims.","You have made a strong connection between the formation of peat and its role in sustaining zombie fires. Your explanation that 'Peat is made out of dead plant organisms, which are sugar-containing carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen' shows a clear understanding of the composition of peat. Additionally, your use of the decomposition investigation to explain how decomposition and cellular respiration release carbon dioxide into the air is a good application of class activities to support your claim. This aligns well with the assignment criteria of making a claim about matter and energy in the zombie fire system and supporting it with specific evidence from class activities."
"     Zombie fires can burn under ice in the Arctic because of the large amounts of peat stored under the permafrost. 
     Peat is a substance made of compressed dead plant matter that layers on top of itself at the bottoms of bodies of water, and as thousands of years pass, the peat forms. The question is, how did that peat form in the first place? Seeing as it's made of dead plant matter, it doesn't make sense that there's so much of it, the Arctic being as uninhabitable as it is. The very answer lies in how the peat is made. Thousands of years ago, the Earth's tilt was slightly larger than it is today, exposing more of the area now known as the Arctic to sunlight. We know from our tilt lab that the more light energy a plant is accessing, the more photosynthesis will occur. The goal was to compare what photosynthesis would have been like in the Arctic when plants there got more sunlight thousands of years ago, and today, when they gets notably less due to the smaller tilt of the Earth. We put one test tube full of parsley, water, and BTB fluid under each of three environments- one with direct light, one with indirect light, and one with no light. BTB is a fluid that changes color from blue to green/yellow as you add carbon dioxide. We wanted to measure the amount of oxygen being produced by the plants (because O2 is a product of photosynthesis), so we added CO2 to the water, turning it green. The more photosynthesis occurred, the more blue/less green the fluid would be because of the newly added oxygen. 
     As predicted, the test tube placed under direct light changed to be the bluest in comparison to the other test tubes, the least changed being the test tube with no light. With no light, comes no photosynthesis, so there was no change. This reaffirms the fact that more photosynthesis occurs when you have more light.
     Peat itself takes thousands of years to form, but the dead plants that make up the peat were formed thousands of years ago, when photosynthesis was more bountiful in the Arctic due to the greater tilt of the Earth and higher sun radiation. As the Earth's tilt shrunk, the plants died and formed peat, which just stayed there, not decomposing, due to the cold temperatures of the Arctic and the lack of oxygen need for cellular respiration to occur. 
     Water holds a much smaller amount of oxygen than air does, and peat is formed underwater, then staying underground- this means there's very little oxygen in the actual peat. We know from the paper we looked at talking about the study between the four different beakers comparing different rates of decomposition when you add in different amounts of oxygen that the more oxygen you have, the more/faster something will decompose. Because of the way peat forms, it's seriously lacking oxygen, so it's harder for it to decompose. 
     In our yeast lab, we learned that the warmer the temperature is, the more something will decompose, and vice versa. This lab was meant to imitate decomposition because yeast is a living thing that can act as a decomposer, so we fed it sugar to see the cellular respiration process. For this lab, we had three separate beakers filled with water, sugar, and yeast- one had cold water, one had room temperature water, and one had warm water. Every two minutes we would measure the amount of foam produced by each beaker, because the foam was made of carbon dioxide and water, two outputs of cellular respiration. This showed us the rate that the three beakers were decomposing. In the lab, the beaker containing cold water had a measurement of 0.4 cm of foam at the end of the twenty minutes, a drastic 4.6 cms less than the 5 cms of the warm beaker. This showed us that warmer temperatures are more ideal for decomposition. The Arctic is constantly incredibly cold, especially in the winter, so it makes sense that in an environment tailored to prevent decomposition, there's huge masses of dead plant matter that isn't decomposing under the permafrost.
     So how does this relate to zombie fires? We know that peat contains huge amounts of carbon/energy from the fuel burning lab that we did and previous knowledge from readings. Because peat stores so much energy and matter and isn't decomposing, it acts as constant fuel for the zombie fires, maintaining them underneath the permafrost.","If the temperature on Earth continues to rise, more peat will burn, melting more permaforst and heating up the atmosphere because of the CO2 being released. When peat burns, energy and carbon dioxide get released. The fire increases the temperature and melts the permafrost above the peat. When said permafrost melts, the peat gets exposed to more oxygen, further increasing the fire. The more fire there is, the more carbon dioxide that gets released. The greater amounts of carbon dioxide then raise the temperature and continue the cycle, burning more permafrost and heating up the atmosphere of the Earth. This cycle will continue, melting the Arctic and destroying the environment.",4,"While your response contains a lot of valuable information, organizing it more effectively would enhance clarity and cohesion. Consider beginning with a concise claim that clearly states the connection between peat, lack of decomposition, and zombie fires before delving into detailed evidence from your labs. This will help set the stage for your explanation. Additionally, ensure that each piece of evidence is explicitly linked back to your main claim about zombie fires to reinforce your argument. Finally, try to weave in how the energy flow and matter transformation occur specifically in the zombie fire system, as this is part of the task criteria.

You also make a strong connection to the Burning Fuel Samples demonstration by mentioning how peat acts as fuel due to its stored carbon and energy."
"Zombie fires can burn under ice due to the amount of permafrost there is above or in the artic itself, I say this due to because of what we did back in our bunring project, Peat took the longest to burn unlike the sticks and the leafs. This could potentially show on how much fire a zombie fire could make.  Another potential piece of evidence could be on what the results were on how our teacher shows up what would happen if it was set on fire, It results that it takes longer time to set it on fire but it doesnt last long. The zombie fires could last long probably due to because of the permafrost doing something with the peat, almost like a chemical reaction or something decomposing in it, or maybe it could be its not really doing anything to the peat to make the zombie fire. ",If the temperature on Earth continues to rise it would cause alot of health issues for us. If it gets to the point were most of the water could evaporate. some things might decompose if they were exposed to the sun most of the time. more people would probablly get skin cancer or a heat stroke. animals would die from not drinking ( potentially though if its hot enough ). there could also probably be less resources for us due to the amount of heat / temperature that rose.,0,"To improve your explanation, it would be beneficial to clarify the connection between peat, permafrost, and zombie fires. Specifically, you could expand on how peat is formed in the arctic environment and why it doesn't decompose quickly, as these are important factors in the persistence of zombie fires. Additionally, try to organize your ideas more clearly by providing a concise sequence of how each element contributes to the fire. For example, you could start with the formation of peat, explain its role in the carbon cycle or decomposition, and then link it to the fire's longevity under ice. This will help create a more cohesive argument that aligns with the assignment criteria of discussing matter and energy flow in the system.","Your response does a good job of integrating class activities as evidence, such as when you reference the ""burning project"" to illustrate how peat takes longer to burn compared to sticks and leaves. This connection helps demonstrate your understanding of the unique properties of peat and how it might contribute to the phenomenon of zombie fires."
zombies fires can burn under the ice for such long periods of time because of the the peat under the ice. peat is dead plantation and the reason there is so much of it is because thousands of years ago the earth was at a slightly different angle than what it is now allowing a lot more sun light to hit the artic which means the plants had more energy to grow and live  but as the earths tilt changed less sun light was able to hit it now plants are dead after years the peat was covered by all the ice not allowing any oxygen to reach it so now that there is no oxygen and extremly cold weather instead of warm it became difficult for the peat to decompose and we learned from burning differents things that even a small amount of peat can burn for hours so imagine how lomng lost of it can do and since peat holds lots of sugar it also containds lots of energy so meaning  it can burn for longer periods of time so when a fire starts and is covered by sonw and surronded by peat it continous to burn using the peat as a fuel source all the way till the snow melts allowing for additional heat and oxygen to reach the flames so they grow again.,there will be a major increase in photosenthesis which will also lead to more plantatiion around the world like places near the eqautor,1,"To improve your response, consider organizing your thoughts more clearly and using scientific terminology more precisely.

"In the past, the arctic was different than today because the tilt of the earth was 2 degrees greater, there was enough light for them to survive, it wasnt cold, and there was enough oxygen. When there was more sun in the arctic it caused plants to grow due to the photosynthesis. When the plants died they didnt decompose. this was shown in the yeast lab where the foam at the top represents the decomposition and CO2 in the different temperatues of water. In cold water, it there was no bubbles at all meaning it didnt breakdown, but in the hot water it had 1.5 cm of foam at the top. the foam on the top represents decomposition becuase when plants decompose they release CO2 and energy. The energy is realesed from the peat we know from the buring fuel samples peat has the most energy, burning for the longest and keeping a higher temp then what it had before we burned it. We know plants release CO2 from the tilt investigation where we put plants in water with no light, partialy under the light, and compleaty under the light. The plant with all of the light turned blue becuase the BTB turns a different color when exposed to CO2. it is origianaly blue but we blew into it to make it yellow, this shows that the plant didnt decompose and still was doing photosynthesis. The chemical equation for photosynthesis is Light+H2O+CO2=O2+C6H12O6 meaning in photosynthesis it releases oxygen. The plant with no light turned even more yellow becuase it couldnt do any photosynthesis becuase it didnt have the light to. it turned even more yellow becuase the plant released more CO2 when it was decomposing. This lab shows that the earths tilt prevented the plants from getting the light that they need to grown and stay alive, when the plants died it was too cold for them to decompose so they just stayed there. On the oxygen and decomposition paper it shows that plants with the least amount of oxygen decompose the least, since the peat was formed under the water, where there is very little oxygen, they couldnt decompose. The zombie fire system has enough energy and matter in the system to burn under the ice and because it was too cold to decompose, there was not enough light in the arctic due to the tilt for the plants to do photosynthesis and stay alive and they dont have enough oxygen to decompose
","If the temperature on earth continures to rise the permafrost with thaw and expose more of the peat meaning it will decompose. The temperatures will be greater meaning it will be easier to decompose and release more CO2 and energy. this also would allow plants to grow becuase they will be able to do photosynthesis and they will take in the CO2 and make oxygen, we know that with more plants means more oxygen and more oxygen means they will decompose easier, becuase they decomposed they will not have the energy stored up to burn for as long as the peat does, meaning the zombie fires will eventully go away.",3,"To enhance your writing, focus on improving organization and clarity.

"Zombie fires burn under ice because the non-decomposed peat within and under the permafrost burns underneath the ground.  The peat that is burning is created by dead plants that are non-decomposed and stuck under the thick layers of ice and snow.  To begin with, the peat that is now on fire was formed thousands of years ago when the earth had a grater tilt allowing a larger percentage of sun to reach that arctic.  11,000 years ago, the earths tilt was about 24.5 degrees and today the tilt is around only 22.1 degrees.  The earths tilt allows more sun to the arctic alllowing more plants to go through photosynthesis.  As the solar radiation was causing photosynthesis we came ot realized that the larger amount of sun the larger amount of plants that go thorugh PSN.  In class, we learned this through our lab with the three test tubes full of BTB and H20 that received different amounts of sunlight with plants inside of each.  Test tube A received full sun, test tube B recieved 50% sun, and test tube C recieved no sun.  The BTB to begin with was a greenish-yellow collow representing that there was CO2 within it, this would go on to show us that if any of the test tubes had color change it would mean that they went through photosynthesis and created oxygen(O2)  and glucose (Sugar - C6H12O6) causing the BTC and H2O mix to become blue once again.  As we both know plants need sun to go through PSN, so concluding to this thought, the next day our test tube with the most sun (A) was now back to blue, the test tube with 50% of sunlight (B) was a teal, and the test tube with no sun(C) was the same color we left it.  This proved to us that the more sun such as the tilt and solar radiation meant the more the plant went through PSN.  This leads us to our continuous thought of how it was affective.  As the tilt decreased so did the amount of sun (solar radiation) which caused less plants to go through photosynthesis and die.  As plants died more and more peat started to form through the thousands of years as the temperatures were too low and there wasn't enough CO2 for them to decompose.  We learned throughout our yeast lab in class that the warmer the temperature of water we put the yeast in, the more it decomposed and the more CO2 it created, our cold and room temperature beakers had no decomposition as our warm water beaker had 3 cm of CO2 within 8 minutes proving to us that the wamer temperature had caused it to start going through decomposition.  This showed us that due to the cold temperatures the peat can only decompose at very slow pace and even barely at points.  This is why there is still so much peat in the arctic.  As the earths tilt continues to decrease the amount of solar radiation is dropping which has caused more and more peat to form throughout thousands of years causing a large build up of peat which is flammable.  As the peat build up and zombie fires continued around, when the seasons changed the fires led underground, how?  While the seasons changed the zombie fires temperatures increased, as these temperatures increased the permafrost began to thaw.  The higher the temperatures the larger the fires will get and the more they will be fueled.  The permafrost is pernanently frozen soil that is around and above the peat.  As this permafrost began to thaw it caused the peat to be exposed to the CO2.  When the peat was exposed to the CO2 it caused the fires to grow larger and release more CO2 into the atmosphere that fuels the fire to begin with.  As we know, peat burns for a while and is hard to put out.  Now knowing the relationship between the peat and the zombie fires, the zombie fires have enough energy and matter within the system to travel down into the peat due to exposing it to CO2 and heat allowing the peat to catch on fire and burn until the season is enough for it to move back above ground; due to the CO2 being released also being was fueling it. ","If the temperature on Earth continues to rise the zombie fires will stay fueld and continue to grow and thrive continously.  There is a large percentage of peat within the permafrost and as mentioned above the heat plays a roll.  When the energy (Heat) is transfereed as the permafrost thaws and the fire reaches the peat, the CO2 being outputted and also fueling will continously alllow the zombie fires to drastically grow and continue as time goes on.  ",3,"To improve your response, consider organizing your ideas more clearly to enhance readability. You might start by clearly separating the explanation of how peat is formed from how it leads to zombie fires. Use paragraphs to separate these ideas. For instance, one paragraph could focus on the formation of peat and another on how zombie fires burn under ice. Additionally, you could strengthen your explanation by explicitly connecting the class activities to your claims. For example, when discussing the yeast lab, you could state more directly how this demonstrates the slow decomposition of peat in cold temperatures, which you mentioned: ""our cold and room temperature beakers had no decomposition.""

You successfully explained how the non-decomposed peat burns under permafrost by stating, ""Zombie fires burn under ice because the non-decomposed peat within and under the permafrost burns underneath the ground."" This shows a clear understanding of the process involved. Additionally, you effectively used evidence from the class to support your claim, such as the lab experiment with BTB and H2O, where you noted, ""Test tube A received full sun, test tube B received 50% sun, and test tube C received no sun,"" to demonstrate the effect of sunlight on photosynthesis, which is vital in understanding the formation of peat."
"There was enough matter and energy in the system for a zombie fire to burn under the ice because of photosynthesis and temperature. For example in the titl lab we had three test tubes with plants in them, one was placed under the light, one was placed next to the light and one recieved no light. The plants submerged in BTB turns from blue to green when there is carbon dioxide exposed to it. The BTB to start out with was green, meaning it was exposed to carbondioxide. By the end of the lab the BTB was blue in the test tubes that were exposed to light, while the testube not exposed to light still had green BTB. This shows the process of photosynthesis because because plants use the inputs of water and carbon dioxide to make the outputs of glucose and oxygen and when the BTB is blue that means there is oxygen in the air, showing us that plants need light to do photosynthesis. When plants make glucose and oxygen from photosynthesis that means they are making energy. This energy is stored in plants so they can survive. Peat is made out of dead plants so that means peat gets its energy from glucose because plants are made out of glucose. This means that the peat is stored with lots of energy because of photosynthesis because plants can't make glucose with out the process of using water and carbon dioxide to make sugar and oxygen. In the reading that we did about the Earth's tilt it told us that 11000 years ago the Earth's tilti was 24.8 degrees. This means that the Arctic ,where peat lies, was recieving more sun meaning the Arctic had more photosynthesis and this is how all the plants were able to survive. Now the Earth's tilit is 22.1 degrees. This is a 3.7 degree difference so the Artic now is recieving significanlty less sun. So because the Arctic has less sun it is colder and all the plants that used to live there died turning into peat. This information shows us that photosynthesis is the reason there is enough energy to let zombie fires burn underground because the Arctic being exposed to more sun caused plants to do photosythesis which made them lots of glucose and energy. When the plants died and turned into peat all the glucose in the plants stayed there, allowing the zombie fires to use that energy to burn underground where peat is found.  In the yeast lab we saw that cellular respiration happens at a faster rate in warmer temperatures. This is true be cause the foam (carbon dioxide) started at the height of 0 cm and rose to the height of four centimeters in the 20 minute time period, whereas the room temp and cold beakers started at 0 cm and stayed at 0 cm for the whole lenght of the 20 minute time period. This shows that warmer temps make cellular respiration happen faster. In the Arctic where the Zombie fires are it is really cold and the peat that is the fuel of zombie fires is under a layer of permafrost which is also really cold. Peat can't make cellular respiration as easily because it is so cold in the arctic now. This means that the peat is able to decompose quickly because of the temperature. This is the reason why the is enough matter for a zombie fire to burn undeground because peat can't decompose easily so there is still lots of it left underground. This leads to zombie fires having more fuel to burn because there is lots of plant matter (peat) left to burn.",If the temperature on Earth continues to rise the permafrost will continue to melt making the peat more exposed to oxygen causing more cellular respiration beecause the high levels of oxygen cause matter to decompose faster which then releases more CO2 into the air which can be catatstrophic to our environment.,3,"While your explanation is strong, you could enhance the organization of your response by explicitly stating your claim at the beginning. This would provide a clear framework for your evidence and make your argument more coherent. Additionally, when discussing the yeast lab, ensure that your explanation of cellular respiration is clearly connected to the decomposition process. You mention that the yeast lab showed that cellular respiration happens faster at warmer temperatures, but it would be beneficial to directly relate this to how the cold conditions in the Arctic limit decomposition in peat, thus preserving it as fuel for zombie fires. Finally, consider breaking down long sentences to enhance readability and ensure that each main idea is presented clearly and concisely.","You have done an excellent job of incorporating evidence from your class activities to support your explanation about zombie fires.

"The reason the zombie fires have burned so long

Since the artic has been frozen for thousands of years and before it freezed up there was vegetation and since peat is dead vegetation it has stayed under the ice for a long time because in the model that we made in class.It shows that since the artic is very cold there is a layer over the peat which is called permafrost which is very cold which slows down the release of Co2.I also know that from the yeast expirement was that the colder enviroment there  is the less Co2 was going to be produced because thats what the peat is making since it is burning while making energy.Since there is a lot of peat the more Co2 is under the permafrost there is going to be a lot ofCo2.

From the Burning fuels samples lab I rember an observation I had was that after it had burned for a long time.It had released a lot of smoke a bit more than the other samples we had burned.It had also lost some of it mass.After it was done burning I also noticed that it was still smoking a bit.I think that is shows that it was carying a lot of energy because it was still burning.

That is the reason zombie fires have burned so long.

Elaborating on how this observation demonstrates the energy flow in zombie fires would strengthen your explanation.","Your response does a good job of incorporating evidence from the class activities, which is a key part of the assignment criteria. For example, you referenced the yeast experiment to explain how a colder environment leads to less CO2 production, which ties into your explanation of the zombie fire system: ""I also know that from the yeast experiment was that the colder environment there is the less Co2 was going to be produced."" This shows your understanding of how temperature affects decomposition and CO2 release."
"There is enough matter and energy for xombie fires to burn because permafrost is cold and because it contains very little oxygen. The reason that this is possible mostly all stems from what peat is. Peat is a carbon based plant material made of long chains of sugars that has been under permafrost and not decomposed. Meaning that all peat was once a living plant. Peat froms by dead vegitation falling into an open body of water. Then over decades more and more dead vegitation burys the first partially filling the body of water witht this dead vegatation. Lastly over hundreds or even thousands of years the body of water will fully filled with this dead vegatation which is peat. In class we did a tilt lab. In this lab we summerged parsely into beakers and filled it with BTB that had already had Co2 in it. In class we leanred when the BTB is blue that means there is no Co2. When it is yellow or green that means there is Co2 present. So when we blew into the BTB we created Co2 present in the tube. We then placed one directley under light, one indirectly, and one with no light. The next day we found that the one with direct light was blue and the others had stayed their green color. This shows the more light a plant has that means they can go through photosyntheisis. This is possible because the light allows the plant to turn Co2 into oxygen and produce sugars. So when we saw the blue BTB we knew that the plant went through photosythesis because it created the Co2 into oxygen. Meaning that the pkant under the light was able to create energy. This means that when the earth had a tilt of 24 degrees thousands of years ago, the Arctic was receiving more sunlight and therefore more plants could stay alive. Meaning that because the plants could go through photosynethis that explains how there is peat there still to this day. This is important because this shows how the peat conatins energy whilst under the permafrost. Then we leanred from out oxygen and decompostition sheet that when more oxygen is present it speeds up decomposition. For example the graph shows that the jar with a lot of oxygen and medium oxgen decomposed at the same rate for the first 40 days. Then suddenly the high additional oxygen dipped down and there was only 10% plant matter by the 50th day. Where the jar with medium amounts had been at 45% by the 50th day. This all relates to the zombie fires because the plants that turned into peat went through photosynthesis which created energy that was then stored in the plant. Realating to decompostition in our yeast lab we also learned about tempatures relating to decomposition. In our beaker we had a warm and cold beaker. The cold beaker did not produce any foam but the warm beaker created 1 1/2 cm of foam. The foam represented carbon dioxide and the foam showed that at warmer climates  converted sugar to coarbon dioxide at higher tempatures. So because of these facts the peat has enough matter and energy because we learned in class that water has very little oxygen meaning that during the winter the peat is unable to decompose. Also because water does not contain very much oxygen and because peat is frozen making it cold means that the energy in the peat of the winter is not able to convert to carbin dioxide meaning that in the spring the peat still has energy to burn because the sugars werent able to convert to Co2 because it was to cold and the peat cant decompose in the perafrost because the tempature is too cold.",If the earths tempature continues to rise that will mean that the zombie fires will continue to get larger. I know that this is correct because on our class model we showed that fire causes the permafrost to thaw out and become warmer. As the permafrosts would continue to get warmer because of the higher tempatures that causes the peat to be exposed to oxygen. Because the peat would be exposed to oxygen it would then cause the peat to burn way faster causing our air to contain much more carbon dioxide. As the fires would continue to get bigger there would be more and more carbon dioxide that wpuld enter the air becaise in class we learned that carbon dioxide is produced by fires burning. Then I predict the because there is more Carbon dioxide more plants would start using the carbon dioxide to produce oxygen and sugar as they photosyntheisise. Then as these plants die they will continue to become peat. Therefore because of these reasons I predivt that if earths tempatures continue to rise there will continue to be fires that will grow at a rapid pace because they will catch trees and other plants on fires therefore many forests and habiutats would be destroyed becaise of these fires.,4,"To improve the organization and clarity of your writing, consider structuring your response in a way that directly addresses the assignment criteria. Start by clearly stating your main claim about how zombie fires can burn under ice. Then, introduce specific evidence from class activities individually, explaining how each piece of evidence supports your claim. For example, when discussing the decomposition lab, explicitly connect the findings to how they relate to the lack of decomposition in permafrost. Additionally, ensure that your sentences are concise and focused. Breaking down long sentences into shorter ones can improve readability and make your explanations clearer. Lastly, remember to check for spelling and grammatical errors to enhance the overall presentation of your work.","Your response does a great job of explaining the formation of peat and why it hasn't decomposed, which are key factors in understanding zombie fires. You clearly describe how peat is formed by stating, ""Peat is a carbon based plant material made of long chains of sugars that has been under permafrost and not decomposed."" Additionally, your reference to the class activity, ""In class we did a tilt lab..."" is effective as it shows a clear connection between class experiments and the scientific concepts discussed in your response."
"There is enough matter and energy in the zombie fire system to burn under the permafrost because the peat has glucose broken down and has oxygen in the peat and fire uses that to burn. I know this because according to my sheet Geological Time, in the past, the artic was different than today because the tilt of the earth 11,000 years ago was 24.5 deggrees and the tilt today is 21.1 deggrees. This means that 11,000 years ago the artic got more solar radiation where the plants could do photosythesis and give off oxygen. And I know from the Oxygen and Decompostition worksheet that when there is more oxygen that plants decompose faster. And a lab we did in class called the Earth's tilt lab, we put parsley in BTB with Co2 already in it and put it under the grow lights and when we came back the BTB was blue because the plant had done photosynthesis which one of the outputs is oxygen. But when the Earth tilted more to what it is today it got colder and colder because there is less solar radiation and that is how permafrost formed. And peat formed from those dead plants but they were slowly decomposing but they aren't fully decomposed. One of the things that fire needs is oxygen and when the peat is burning under ground it is filled with some of that oxygen from the old plants. And that is how the zombie fire system has enough energy to have fire burn under the permafrost.","If the temperature on Earth continues to rise, I think there would be more Co2 in the air. I think this because when we did our Yeast Lab, we had used three different beakers and the warmer beaker had made 2.8 cm of foam which the foam is made of Co2, and the cold beaker and room temperature beaker were only making .5 cm of foam. So when living are doing cellular respiration, (the process of which living things convert glucose into usable engery, Co2 and water.) then I think there will be more Co2 in the air.",3,"To strengthen your explanation further, consider organizing your response more clearly by explicitly connecting each piece of evidence to your main claim. For instance, start with a clear claim, such as ""Zombie fires can burn under ice because of the presence of oxygen from partially decomposed peat."" Then, follow with structured evidence: 1) Discuss how peat formed historically due to changes in Earth's tilt and solar radiation, using your Geological Time sheet evidence. 2) Explain how this peat hasn't fully decomposed, drawing on the Oxygen and Decomposition worksheet. 3) Finally, link these points back to how oxygen supports combustion in zombie fires. This structured approach will enhance the clarity and effectiveness of your argument. Also, ensure to check for spelling and grammatical errors, such as 'deggrees' instead of 'degrees', and 'photosythesis' instead of 'photosynthesis', to improve the overall presentation of your response.","Your response effectively uses evidence from the class activities and worksheets to support your explanation about the zombie fire system.

This demonstrates a good grasp of how historical changes in Earth's tilt influenced solar radiation and subsequently, peat formation."
"As we have learned in clas the artic was diffrent than today because, the Peat permafrost, carbon work sheet, we know that peat is formed from plants that grow, then die and pile up on wet swampy areas, like the artic 11,000 years ago. 11,000 years ago, the earths tilt was 24.5, and as it says on the sheet a greater angle of tilt, the more the artic will get solar radiation. when there is solar radiation, we know that there is more photosynthisis, like we saw in the tilt lab, there was 3 breakers, beaker A which has direct light, then there was becker b which had in direct light, the beaker C which had no light. all of these beakers started with the same color of BTB a yellow color/ which represented carbon dioxide. Beaker As BTB chnaged the most from yellow to blue, we know that this means that it realeased the most O2, and has the most photosynthisis. Beaker b changed very silightly from yellow to a yellow ish green color which shows that there was a meduim amount of photosynthisi, and then becaker c didnt change at all, and this means there was no photosynthisis. Beaker a represent what the tilt was likw 11,000 years ago when all of the peat was formed in the artic, During this time period the amount of photosynthisis was way larger, because the artic was getting more solar radiation, we know that because of this this is why all of the plants that were now peat grew , was because there was a larger tilt. the peat that is in the artic from 11,000 years ago is still prenst because of the decomposition rate is much smaller due to the small amount of oxygen that there is in the artic. As we learned from the yeast lab, The warmer the temps are, the more co2 is created. In the yeast lab there was 3 beakers on with warm water one with room temp, and one with cold. The warm beaker had 5cm of foam, when beaker 2 had only 0.5 and 3 had 0.25. we know that the foam is created com cellular reperation just like the decomposition of the peat, yeast is a drecomposer and it eats and breaks down C6h1206, and then will makes energy which was represented by the foam , CO2 +h2o . as we saw in the lab, the amount of energy created between all of the beakers was largest in the warm one. Warmer tems lead to more co2 whoch means there is mor edecomposition, because carbon dioxide is being realed and decomposed the plants . Along with that the more o2 that there was avalible, the more decompostion there was and we saw that ib the decompostion graph The one with high additonal oxygen after 100 days only had 12% pf plamnt matter lef compawired to the one with no additonal oxygen which ahd 62% left, this is about a 60% diffrence compaired to high additional oxygen. this means that there is no addional oxygen theis mean the ahte % of plant matter will be high whoch mean less o2, which will lead to the decompostition.  just like in the artic, the  dead plants are made up of c6h12o6, and just like in the yeast lab, the smoke is turing the oeat into co2 and h20 which means that the mattter and energy are being transdred to the apmosphere just like it was in the yeast that.  and when the fite is buring,  since peat is fomed in water there is not much 02 in h20, because it is too cold, the cold beaker with no foam is reoresentig the permafrost and the atic. ","If the temperature on Earth continues to rise, the zimbie fires in the artic will increase, because of the zombie fires increase the temptures will increase. with increasing  temptures, the pf will thaw, when the pf thaws the  peat will become more exposed to oxygen, and the fires will begin to grow biggger, which will lead to more O2 in the atmosphere. I think that when there is more 02 in the atomosphere, the more priblems it  will lead to in the ecosystem. ",4,"To improve your writing, try to organize your thoughts more clearly and concisely. Starting with a brief outline might help. For example, begin with a clear claim about how zombie fires can burn under ice, then follow with evidence from class activities. You could state, 'Zombie fires can burn under ice because peat, formed under conditions of high solar radiation 11,000 years ago, remains due to low decomposition rates.' Then, continue with specific examples from your experiments, like the yeast lab, to support your claim. Also, make sure to check for spelling and grammar errors to enhance readability, such as correcting 'fite' to 'fire' and 'reoresentig' to 'representing.' Finally, consider using paragraph breaks to separate different ideas or sections, which will make your argument easier to follow.","You did a great job incorporating evidence from class activities like the 'Yeast/Decomposition Lab' and the 'Elodea/Earth’s Tilt lab' to explain the matter and energy flow in the zombie fire system. For instance, you explained that 'the peat is formed from plants that grow, then die and pile up on wet swampy areas, like the arctic 11,000 years ago.' This shows a clear understanding of how peat forms and persists in cold environments. Additionally, your use of the beaker experiment to illustrate photosynthesis under different light conditions was well explained and directly connected to your claim."
"There was enough matter and energy in the system in a zombie fire to burn under ice because of the earths tilt and everything related to it. In the past, the artic was different than today because the earths tilt was greater. 11,000 years ago the earths tilt was at 24.5 degrees. While now the earths tilt is at 22.1. These are 2 very big differences because having a larger tilt means more solar radiation, more solar radiation means that that the sun was able to provide more energy in the artic. This means there was more photosynthesis. We did a couple of labs to help us get a better understanding of cellular resperation and photosynthesis. Since we're talking about the sun our tilt investiagtion lab was what was used to understand that. In our lab we started off with 3 test tubes all with the same amount of carbon dioxide(CO2) and this was our input.They all had  test tube A was tested under direct light(meant to represent the sun), test tube b was tested under indirect light, and test tube c had no light. We clearly saw that test tube A went completely blue which meant photosynthesis was able to happen, this is because it released the most oxygen(O2). Test tube B was also able to go through photosynthesis but it released a medium amount of O2. Test tube C did not change at all and it had more CO2 present. To get a better understanding of peat and the zombie fires here's some background. Peat is dead vegetation that takes thousands of years to comepletey form. This dead vegetation falls into a body of water which means it has little to no oxygen aincw water(H2O) has 1% or less in it. This affects its decomposition rate and why it lasts so long. Permafrost is permanently frozen which means it stayes in a solid form of matter. This will change during warmer temps. A lab that can confirm this is the yeast lab. In the yeast lab we had 3 different beakers. Beaker A was warm water, Beaker B was room temp, and Beaker c was cold water. At 8 minutes Warm was at 3cm, RT was at 1cm and Cold stayed at 0cm. This was CO2 + H20. The bubbles/ represented carbon dioxide and cellular resperation. These investgations help understand that when the fire temp increased, this made the pf thaw, when the peat get's exposed like in the images below and it continued burning, it will eventually grow larger and continue the cycle. The reason this has shfited from 11,000 years ago is because a larger tilt meant more photosynthesis which meant more peat underground now. With the smaller tilt we have today (22.1) there's less energy. The images above show how peat can continue to burn in already burned areas and that's from energy as well and CO2, it makes it burn bigger, longer and more CO2 in the atmoshphere. This all are factors from the earths tilt as well, everything is connected.","If the temperatures on earth continue to rise there will be even more zombie fires. We learned that with a warmer temperatature there would be more solar radiation and that means more sunlight, therefor more energy. This means even more peat would form, before it dies it naturally does go through photosynthesis and thats how we get it. With more things being able to do this we would get more peat and we already know that it can burn for an extremly long time due its circumstances.  More sugar would also be formed and this is an input/energy source. Its also stored inside of the peat helping it burn. More of this means more of everything. The fires would increase and the paragraphs above can also help support this.",3,"To improve your response, focus on organizing your information more clearly and ensuring each part of the assignment criteria is addressed. For instance, when discussing how peat hasn't decomposed and its relevance to zombie fires, you mention: ""Peat is dead vegetation that takes thousands of years to completely form...This affects its decomposition rate and why it lasts so long."" However, it would strengthen your argument if you explicitly connected this to how it allows zombie fires to persist. Additionally, ensure your explanation is concise and directly tied to the evidence from class. Consider summarizing the yeast lab more succinctly and directly linking it to the survival and behavior of zombie fires.

"There is enough matter and energy in the zombie fire system for the fires to burn because the dead plants that are being burned are in too cold of temperatures to decompose and they are formed in places with little oxyegen. The Geologic Time paper taught us that 11,000 years ago, the Earth's tilt was at an angle of 24.5 degrees. It also stated that a greater angle of tilt would result in the arctic being exposed to more of the sun (solar radiation), meaning that the plants could harness the sun energy and convert it into sugar and oxygen through photosynthesis. However, the tilt gradually decreased and today is only at 22.1 degrees. This means that the plants no longer recieve enough sunlight to produce their food, and they ended up dying. As the climate got colder, the dead plant matter formed peat, which got trapped underneath the cold layer of permafrost. In class, when we did the yeast decomposition lab, we found that the foam (carbon dioxide) in the warm beaker grew by 5 inches, meaning that carbon dioxide was being produced and decomposition was happening at a fast rate. However, over the same course of time, the foam in the cold beaker grew 0 inches, meaning that no carbon dioxide was produced and no decomposition occured. This relates to our zombie fire system because it tells us that the reason that peat cannot break down is because it is in such a cold enviornment, which is why it is so prominant. Aditionally, when peat forms, it forms in water, which we learned in class does not contain a lot of oxygen. When we looked at the graph on the oxygen and decomposition paper, we found that the bottle with high additional oxygen dropped from having 80% of plant matter of 10% over the course of 100 days, but over the same time period, the bottle with no additional oxygen only dropped from 83% to about 63%. Since oxygen is an input for decomposition, decomposition cannot occur with little to no oxygen. Since peat is formed in an enviornment with little oxygen, the decomposition rates take very long. This means that the matter and energy that is being burned is the dead plants, which are made of glucose, that cannot decompose because of the cold temperatures and lack of oxygen. ","If the temperature on Earth continues to rise, zombie fires will burn more often and will last longer. This is because as temperatures on Earth rise, permafrost will melt. This will expose the oxygen from the air to the peat. Since oxygen is an input for fire, this exposure will allow the fires to easily burn. The heat from the fires will further melt the rest of the permafrost, and fires will spred all across the arctic. Since CO2 is an output of fire, there will be also be an increase of C02 in the air, which we know because in class, when we burned the peat, the BTB changed from blue to green, meaning that C02 was present.

"     Zombie fires can burn under the ice due to a handful of conditions, one being that it has fuel to burn. We know that peat is layers of compact vegitation formed in places such as swamps or marshes that haven't yet decomposed, so it's dense, flammable, and light. The peat is being burned underneath the permafrost, keeping these zombie fires alight. This is where the fires get their name, because the flames never seem to die. 
     So, we have our matter: peat. In the Burning Fuels Demo,  we set fire to the same amount (0.8 grams) of peat, leaves, and sticks, letting them burn for the same amount of time before measuring mass after being burned and the amount of CO2 released due to the burning. We found that peat didn't flame, only sparked a few embers. Although all three materials were burned for the same amount of time, peat lost the most mass, with 0.2 grams remaining, compared to the 0.5 grams remaining of the sticks and the 0.4 grams remaining of the leaves. We also found that the peat had released the most CO2 because it changed the BTB the most. This is significant to us because we know that CO2 is an input in photosynthesis.
     We also know from the Tilt Model we did in class that today, the Earth's tilt is greater than it was 11,000 years ago. The current tilt is 24.5 degrees, whereas it used to be 22.1 degrees. How is this relevant? Well, it's displayed on the model that the greater the angle of tilt, the more of the Arctic gets direct solar radiation (and vise versa). That means more energy via sunlight. We know from when we did our lab with the parsley and BTB that the more light energy inputted into plants means there's more of an output, as well as our Yeast Lab. The Yeast Lab showed that the warmest temperature had the most bubbles (2 cm at 8 minutes versus the 0.5 cm of bubbles present in the cold beaker at the same time), meaning that decomposition happened the fastest when the temperature was warmer. The solar radiation from the sun gives off heat and light energy, meaning the Arctic grows warmer the more sun it gets.
     That was a lot. Now to tie it all together.
     For starters, we know that for a plant to undergo photosynthesis, there must be an input of energy (from the sun), CO2, and H2O. The water is present, as well as CO2 from the previous/current burning of the peat. Sunlight is already shining at a higher rate than before thanks to the increase in the Earth's tilt. We know that the more input means more output, so more and more energy is being created via photosynthesis. As more fire burns, more CO2 is released as a reaction, giving more input for the plants. Eventually, however, the plants die, leaving them to become fuel for future fires. The cycle repeats as plants die, burn, and photosynthesize over and over. The freshly-turned peat now begins to burn under the permafrost, repeating the cycle, thanks to the inputs. 
      Essentially, the energy is provided from the sun. We get the matter from the cycle of peat being burned which fuels other plants along with sunlight and water, all for the plants to eventually turn to peat which will (likely) be burned later. ","     If the temperature on Earth begins to rise, this will increase the amount and longevity of zombie fires. As demonstrated in the Yeast Lab, we know that the warmer the temperature is, the faster matter will decompose. This is proven when our warm beaker produced 2 cm of CO2 bubbles, compared to the 0.5 cm of bubbles produced by the coldest beaker after the same amount of time. We also saw in the Tilt Model we made in class that the Earth's tilt increased 3.4 degrees in 11,000 years, increasing the amount of direct solar radiation on the Arctic. The more solar radiation means the more energy being provided, both heat and light energy. It's already been proved in the written paragraph above that the more solar radiation (sun energy) that's present, the more input is present, so the fires will have more fuel. If the temperature rises and the Arctic as a whole is warmer, the zombie fires will burn more often and for longer.",3,"To enhance your response, consider organizing your ideas more clearly to make your explanation easier to follow.

"Well Zombie fires can burn under ice because theres dead plants ( peat ) under the ice that has been there for thousands of years. the lab we did with burning the sticks, peat, and dried up leafs. The peat burned longer then the sticks, and leafs,  which means that since plants are basicially leafs the peat made the fire comeback to life and when we burned the peat it lit on fire the fastest and when the peat is burning carbon dioxide is coming out of it which looks like smoke and for that to work it needs energy it uses energy which is C02 and the peat makes the fire burn for a while.",That whole place in the model/picture will spread so far and theres gonna be a huge burn mark from the zombie fires.,1,"To improve your response, try to clarify how the energy flows into and out of the zombie fire system.

"In the past, the arctic was different than today because when the peat originally formed it was a lot warmer than it is today. Peat is made out of dead vegetation that forms over hundreds and thousands of years as the plants in the arctic grow, die and stack up underwater in places like bogs or swamps. So much peat was able to form because of the Earths Tilt.The tilt of the earth around 11 thousands years ago was 24.5 degrees; this made it so the arctic got a lot more sun because now the tilt is about 22.1 degrees meaning a lot less sun. When the Arctic had more sun, the plants were more susceptable to undergoing photosynthesis. There was enough matter and energy in the system for a zombie fire because of the amount of energy and heat.

There was enough matter and energy in the system for a zombie fire because of the amount of energy that could be made.In class we did an experiment inspired by the earths tilt-- the tilt lab. A piece of parsley was put into 3 test tubes with different amounts of light to see if oxygen was formed. Test bottle A had a direct light source which can be compared to 11 thousands years ago when the earth's tilt was bigger. The other test tube, test tube B had an indirect light source. And finally test tube C had no light source at all. The final 2 can be compared to the earth's tilt now. To test if any of the test tubes had actually created oxygen; carbon dioxide filled BTB was placed in the test tubes as well. The BTB was green with the added CO2 but if oxygen was created it would turn blue. The parsley sat in the BTB overnight. The next day Test tube B's BTB was teal, C was Green and A was blue. Test Tube B and C's BTB had berely, if not changed at all. The parsley did not produce a good amount of oxygen in either test tube. But in Test tube A in the direct light the BTB had turned blue, meaning the direct sunlight in test tube A aided in creating oxygen. Since the direct sunlight had created the most oxygen out of  all the test tubes. Peat can be compared to the parsely in this lab and since the energy from the sun helped with creating more matter (peat) there was enough matter and energy for a zombie fire.

There was enough matter and energy in the system for a zombie fire because of the amount  heat availiable. In class another experiment we did was the yeast lab. 3 Test tubes were filled with yeast and sugar with water at different temperatures (cold, room temp, and hot). The test tubes modeled a zombie fire ecosystem. The bottles were given 20 minutes to rise or to not rise. After 20 minutes the Cold beaker had risen 0 cm, the room temperature rose 0.5 centimeters and the Hot beaker had risen 4.5 cm. In the yeast lab more sugar was converted into carbon dioxide (more bubbled) at higher temperatures. The flow of energy was a lot stronger in the beaker with the hottest water whereas it was significantly weaker in the coldest beaker. This relates back to zombie fires because the cold beaker represents how the Permafrost was frozen solid and the peat was trapped and could not decompose (no carbon dioxide to aid it). The room temp beaker showed that the zombie fires are slowly thawing the permafrost which then in return makes the peat decompose little by little (a little carbon dioxide to aid it). Then finally, the warm beaker shows that if the zombie fires keep burning the permafrost will continue to melt and the peat will decompose a lot more (makes a lot of carbon dioxide to aid it). To sum it up, the higher the temperatures will equal more peat burning which then in return will create more carbon dioxide. The heat helps aid the zombie fires to keep burning for longer times and create more damage. Since the heat helps zombie fires burn under ice, There was enough matter and energy in the system for a zombie fire because of the amount  heat availiable.



",If the temperature on Earth continues to rise zombie fires will occur a lot more and burn for longer amounts of times. The hotter the temperatures the more permafrost will melt meaning peat will be able to burn longer which in return creates more C02 to aid the burning. If the future temperatures continue to rise there will be significantly more visible burn scars.,3,"To improve your writing, consider organizing your response in a clearer structure by breaking down the explanation into distinct sections. For example, explicitly label the paragraphs according to the specific aspect of the zombie fire system you are discussing, such as 'Formation of Peat', 'Role of Energy from Sun', and 'Impact of Temperature on Decomposition'. This will help the reader follow your argument more easily. Additionally, make sure to connect the scientific concepts more explicitly to the phenomenon of zombie fires. You mention processes like photosynthesis and decomposition, but ensure these connections are clear throughout your explanation to address the task criteria of applying multiple scientific ideas to your explanation. Finally, avoid repetition in your conclusion to keep your writing concise.","You have done a great job in explaining the concept of zombie fires and using specific class activities to support your claims.

For instance, when you wrote, ""The parsley sat in the BTB overnight. The next day Test tube B's BTB was teal, C was Green and A was blue,"" you effectively connected the outcome of the experiment to the historical context of peat formation. Additionally, your connection of the yeast lab to the concept of zombie fires, especially in describing how ""the hotter beaker had risen 4.5 cm,"" provides a strong empirical basis for your explanation."
"Zombie fires can burn under ice because the ground is covered in peat. 

According to our reading called Peat, Permafrost, and Carbon, peat is formed over hundreds or thousands of years when layers of dead plants decompose only very slowly. The Arctic has very few plants now, but thousands of years ago, there were enough plants to form lots of peat. This is because the Earth had a greater angle of tilt, and the Arctic got more solar radiation. Plants need light to grow and photosynthesize, and this was proven in our tilt lab. The inputs for photsynthesis are light, water, and carbon dioxide, and the outputs are oxygen and glucose. This means that plants need light, water, and carbon dioxide to conduct photosynthesis. This was shown in our tilt lab when we put plants in test tubes in varying amounts of light. Each test tube was originally filled with yellow BTB, which indicates that there is CO2 in the liquid. Because plants take in CO2 and let out oxygen during photosynthesis, the BTB in the test tubes where photosynthesis was happening would turn blue from the oxygen. After 24 hours, the test tube that was in direct sunlight came back with blue BTB, and the test tube that was not exposed to light still had yellow BTB. This proves that plants need light for photosynthesis because the plants with light released oxygen and the plants with no light did not. This connects to the formation of peat in the Arctic because it shows that it would have been easier for plants to grow there when the Arctic was tilted towards the sun and got more direct solar radiation. Those plants would have decomposed very slowly and turned into peat. Because they are not decomposed all the way, the peat still holds the energy that the plants held from photosynthesis.

The peat was able to form in the Arctic because of how slow the plants there decomposed. The plants decomposed so slowly for multiple reasons. One reason is because it is cold in the Arctic. Cellular respiration (decompostion) happens more slowly in the cold, and this was proven during our yeast lab. In the lab, we had 3 glass jars (representing the zombie fire ecosystem) filled with yeast, water, and sugar. The yeast represented decomposers in the peat, the water represented water and ice in the peat, and the sugar represented the plant matter in the peat. Each glass jar had a different temperature of water: cold, room temperature, and warm. As the yeast and sugar sat in the water, they produced CO2, which came out of the water in the form of foam. This meant that we could measure the height of the foam to find out how much CO2 each jar was producing. After ten minutes, the jar with hot water had over 1 centimeter of foam, and the jar with cold water only had around 4 milimeters of foam. This connects to peat formation in the Arctic because CO2 is an output of cellular respiration. The yeast in the jars was decomposing, and produced more bubbles of CO2 the more it decomposed. So, the results of the lab show that cellular respiration happens slower in the cold because the jar with cold water produced less CO2. 

This shows that peat is the reason that there is enough matter and energy in the system for a zombie fire to burn under ice. The peat has stored energy from the plants it is made of, which causes an easier combustion reaction. Fire needs energy to burn, and it gets that from the peat. When the fire burns the matter and energy are transferred into the atmosphere in the form of smoke.","If the temperature on Earth continues to rise, more of the permafrost in the Arctic will melt, exposing more of the peat to oxygen. Fires need oxygen (from the atmosphere) and energy/fuel (which they will get from the peat) to burn, and when more of the permafrost melts, the peat will set on fire more easily. This means that more fires will burn, releasing more CO2 into the atmosphere, which would warm up the gobal temperature even more. This would cause even more permafrost to melt, exposing more and more peat to oxygen, and cause a looping reaction that gets worse and worse, warming up the temperature more and causing more fires.",3,"To improve your response, consider organizing your ideas more explicitly around the assignment criteria.

Additionally, your description of the yeast lab effectively demonstrates how decomposition occurs more slowly in colder temperatures, connecting this to the slow decomposition of Arctic peat."
"Zombie fires can burn under ice and there is enough matter to do it because of the earths tilt, and tempature. I know this because during class we learned about how the tilit of our earth is only 22.1 now but way back then, 11,000 years ago the tilt was 24.5. This is important to the zombies fires because tilt effects the amount of time that the sun is shining onto the arctic and more light equals more photosynthesis. I know this because in our Tilt Investigation Lab we did a experiment to see if light really did effect photosynthesis. First during our lab we got 3 beakers and did the same thing with all of them, We put our parsley into 3 test tubes and poured in a BTB soulution which had carbon dioxide/CO2 blowed into it by our teacher. The CO2 made the BTB a green color when its original color was blue. We then divded the tests tubes up by labeling them A, B, and C. We put A into direct sunlight, B into indirect sunlight, and C into no light. We let these sit overnight and in the morning they had changed color. Test tube A which was in the light turned back into the oringial blue, Test tube B had slightly changed to a more blue green, and test tube C turned into a yellowish color. This shows that when we had one of the plants under the light it had more photosynthesis because the color had gone back to its original blue meaning more oxygen was introduced into the tube. I know when plants create photosynthesis an output is oxygen. I also know that no light or in the case of the earth, no solar radiation makes no photosnythesis because our test tube that had no light had even less oxygen than before because it was even less blue than it was in the beggining. Now this connects back to the earths tilt being important because this lab proves that the more sun the more photosynthesis and back then when the tilit was 24.5 there was more sun/solar radiation, therefor making more vegitation. I know that peat is made from dead vegitation which is made from sugar and centuries of layers of it  being decomposed because of an article I read in class about peat forming. So because the tilt was bigger back then there was more peat being made. And I learned that peat is whats being burned in there zombies fires because of the ""How does this Relate to zombie fires"" Modle we made. So because of all the peat that was made 11,000 years ago that how I know that there was enough matter being made for these fires. Now I also know that the tempature effects the Zombie fires because the hotter something is the more energy being made. I know this because in class we did a decompasition investigation by having 3 beakers all filled with water. We then put sugar and yeast into all of them. The beakers differd because one had hot water 2 had room tempature water, and 3 had cold water. We let the beakers sit and then saw that there were 5 centimeter of foam which has CO2 in it in the hot beaker after 10 minutes. The cold one had none after 10 minutes. This shows that the hotter the tempature the more energy and CO2 that is going to be made. Now this connects back to zombie fires being able to burn through ice because during zombie fires this happens to the peat that was made possible 11,000 years ago, and I know from my zombie fire Diagram that there is fire, of course burning and the peats tempature is rising causing the permafrost to melt and allowing more CO2 to break into the atmosphere creating a repeating cycle of carbon being put into the atmosphere again, and again. So because of the tempature being hotter because of the fire it allows the permafrost to melt and thats why the zombie fire systems can burn under ice. In conclusion the amount of tilt and solar radiation 11,000 years ago and because of the hot tempatures under the permafrost that is why zombies fires can burn  and have enough energy under thre ice and have enough matter to do so. ","If the tempature on the Earth continues to rise more CO2 will be realseased into the atmostphere and more zombie fires will be made. I know this because In our diagram we made of zombie fires peat is being burned in the earth. If the earths tempatures are more this will lead to more peat being burned and more energy being created. I know when peat is being burned it is burining through layers of permafrost because of how hot and how much energy it has. When the peat burns the glucose/sugar in the peat is coming thought the permafrost and realeasing CO2 into the air because those are the outputs of peat being burned which is what we learned from out tilt lab where we found out plants create carbon because our test tube with no light as i explaned above produced more of a yellow color which we found out means more carbon because its opposite of more of a blue color is creating more oxygen and oxygen is almost the oppisite of CO2. So because of the higher temps peat will be burned, and fires will spread creating more CO2 into our atmosphere which is not good because humans breathe in oxygen and Realses CO2 and if there is to much CO2 in the air we will not be able to breathe and will not have enough oxygen.",2,"While your response includes strong evidence and explanations, consider organizing your ideas more clearly to enhance readability.

Additionally, you successfully connect the decomposition lab results to explain how temperature affects energy production, which relates to how zombie fires can burn under ice."
" There was enough matter and energy in the system for a zombie fire to burn under ice because of all the peat. The peat in the artic doesnt decompose because of how cold the artic is. Less co2 is better for the permafrost and peat because when more peat burns that means more co2 is released and when more co2 gets released the tempature starts to increase( hotter). Peat is formed by dead vegatation (plants). Those plants were made out of glouce(sugar). The sugar molecules that the plants are made of is carbon,oxygen, and hydrogen atoms. The peat were once  plants that created photosynthesis. The peat has energy+H2O+ Co2 meaning the co2 works as a fuel for the fires to continue  burning/smoking. For example the yeast lab, the yeast was the decomposer (living thing). The bubbles was the carbon dioxide in the fire. The bubbles was mixed with co2 and h20. The bubbles was the output of carbon dioxide and water mixing. Energy flows in and out of the zombie fire system because of photosynthesis and cellular respiration. The equation for celluar respiration is C6H12O6+O2 -> Co2 + H20+energy. This means that the more celluar respiration is present in the peramfrost the longer the zombie fire will burn. Now the artic wasnt always like this.  11,000 years ago the earths tilt used to be around 24.3 inches  tilted and now it has started to get straighter by decreasing to around 23.2 inches. In summary in the tilt lab the beaker under direct sunlight did  the most photosynthesis and released the most co2 and o2 . In the yeast lab the bubbles was creating the co2, so if peat gets warm it will release co2 making the fires spread and stay lite longer. Photosynthesis builds the plant material that eventually forms peat, while slow decompositon perserves it. The climate system results from zombie fires, a special point where the long term processes of photosynthesis and cellular respiration interact with combustion.",Zombie fires might spread a lot because the permafrost will start to thaw and the peat will be exposed to more co2  that will make the fires stay lite even longer. The glouce in the peat will start to decrease because more peat is burning. This might result in a chemical chnage which is when energy stored becasue of how atmos are arranged or energy stored when atmos are rearrange,2,"To improve your response, consider organizing your writing more clearly to enhance readability.

For instance, when you mention 'In the yeast lab, the bubbles were creating the CO2,' further clarify how this demonstrates the process of decomposition contributing to the fire's energy.

"Zombie fires can burn under ice because of the solar radiation and the titl. Solar radiation and tilt affects the artic in a big way becuase from our tilt investagation we learned that the reason that the artic used to be much warmer becuase of the tilt which was 24.5 degrees and the artic had al lot of solar radiation which helped peat produce carbon dioxide much more easier then the current tilt which is 22.1 degrees and less solar radiation points on the artic and the peat takes longer to produce carbon dioxcide. In the past, the artic was different than today becuase in our tilt investagation which shows what direct and inderect sunlight can do to plants releasing carbon dioxcide which shows how much of an affect solar radiation has on the artic for example, the direct sunlight BTB container shows that it turned a light blue from being in the sunlight which means that there was more photosynthesis and more oxygen then the BTB container that was not in any light which means that there was no photosynthesis going on in the container becuase there was no solar radiation and sunlight. ",If the temperature on Earth continues to rise then permafrost will began to thaw out which is exposeing peat to the oxygen and if a zombie fire happens it would burn longer. The smoke from the zombie will then start to release carbon dioxcide. From our yeast lab it shows that when its hotter that the foam starts to rise and gets up to 2.8 cm in our lab and that relates to if the artic gets warmer tempatures and that when its hotter its releases more carbon dioxcide then the other tempatures room temp and cold.,1,"To improve your response, consider organizing your ideas more clearly and concisely.

This demonstrates a strong connection to the assignment criteria, particularly in citing evidence from activities like the 'Elodea/Earth’s Tilt lab.'"
"Zombie fires can burn under the ice because of the layers of peat that have formed. Peat is preserved plant matter that is unable to decompose due to its location. Decomposition requires both oxygen and heat. The Oxygen and Decomposition paper showed an expirment where high additional oxygen led to faster decomposition rates. In the container with no additional oxygen, the plant matter percent went from 80% to 60% aproxiamently in 100 days. But when high amounts of oxygen were added, the plant matter percent went from 80% to 10% in 100 days. This means that oxygen is very important in decomposition. We know that peat is formed from dead plants in water where there is little oxygen. In the past, around 11,000 years ago, the tilt of the earth was greater. When the tilt was 24.5 degrees 11,000 years ago, the Arctic was far warmer. In the present, the tilt 22.1 degrees, it became colder to the point where all the bodies of water that peat formed in where frozen over with a layer of perma frost, preventing decomposition, since it will also block oxygen. This has allowed these layers of peat to be preserved for millenia. The other part of decomposition is heat. The Arctic is extremely cold, preventing decomposition. Acording to our Yeast lab, we saw that warmer water led to more CO2 bubbles, an output of decomposition. Yeast put in with cold water produced no CO2, while yeast put in warm water produced 15cm of foam. this means that decomposers like yeast are able to do what they do far better in warmer temperatures. The Arctic now has no means of decomposing peat. To feed a fire, it needs energy to burn. Plants use photosysnthesis to create energy in the form of glucose from CO2, water, and light. When the plants die, the energy of the sugar is preserved because of the aformentiened reasons. Acording to the Tilt Lab, we know that oxygen is also produced with photosysthesis. BTB reacts when exposed to CO2 by changing colors from blue to green or yellow, and oxygen turns it back. In test tube A, it recieved the most amount of light, and its color was the closest to the original blue. However, Test tube C recievied no light at all, and its color remained the same. This shows that more light meant more photosysnthesis, which means more plants. If the Arctic had more sunlight 11,000 years ago, it would not only mean that the it would be warmer, but would also have far more photosysnthesis. More photosysnthesis means more plants, so there must have been far more plants in the Arctic to be preserved under the ice in the past. Then when a fire comes now, it can burn all that preserved energy and sustain itself.","As the temperature continues to rise, permafrost will thaw, exposing more peat, allowing it to burn. when it does burn, it realeases CO2 and if enough is released, it will contribute more to the warming of the planet. so if the teperature continues to rise, it will self perpetuate it self and release more and more CO2, increasing the temerature more.",4,"To enhance your response, you could organize your ideas more clearly by separating different concepts into distinct paragraphs.

"in the past the arctic was diffrent than today because well first in the past the artic was more cokder and permafrost was better which help the fires from spreading.but noe due to the climate change the arctic has way warmer tempertures leading to the permafrost melting qnd the vegetation drying  this make fires more frequent even under snow and ice so the that you see. peat is still in the arctic decomped plant material that has been collectied over the years, the cold and wet tempertures in the arctic led to a slower decomposing process. allowing more peat.

"The peat is formed by dead plantation and dead plantation is made by sugar(glucose) and when the temperture start to rise or the zombie fire still goes because under the ice the gasses of the fire are stuck under so the temperture keeps rising and the peat or dead plantation starts to burn also.

"There was enough matter and energy in the system for a zombie fire because increased energy from the sun caused matter and energy to be stored as sugar in the peat in the zombie fire system. 11,000 years ago in the Arctic Earths tilt was 24.5 degrees compared to earths tilt now, which is 22.1 degrees. This means that 11,000 years ago the tilt allowed more solar radiation to the arctic so plants could grow and go through photosynthesis. This is shown in the Tilt investigation when all three of the test tubes start out with a light greenish clear color. Test tube A is put in direct sunlight, Test tube B is put in indirect sunlight, and test tube C is put in no light at all. Test tube As BTB completely changed to blue color while test tube B changed to a blueish green color, and test tube C didn't change at all. When the BTB changed from the greenish clear to blue in test tube A it showed that there was oxygen because there was a greater color change all the other tubes. The output of photosynthesis is C6H1202 so we know thta more sugar is being made. These dead plants made of sugar 11,000 years ago layer upon eachother and get compressed. This forms peat. The peat in the arctic was never able to decompse because it needs a warmer temperature. This is shown in the yeats labe when we mixed yeast with warm, room temperature, and cold watter. From the eveidence collected, warm water made the yeast bubble up more than the room temperature or cold water did. This shows that in the zombie fire system the arctic won't be able to decompose the the plants because it is too cold for there to be any decomposition so there will be nothing breaking down the plants so they will stay frozen together. When fires start the peat is exposed to O2 the fire will get bigger. This will cause CO2 to be released in to the atmosphere.",If the teperature on Earth continues to rise there will be more zombie fires. I think this will happen because the rising temperature will make the permafrost melt and release more O2. The more O2 the more the fire will grow and release more CO2 in the air.,3,"To enhance your explanation, consider organizing your response more clearly by breaking it into sections that address each part of the question separately.

"There was enough matter and energy because peat retains the zombie fires for a long time. According to the Tilt Investigation poster we made, we know that the arctic has changed since 11,000 years ago because the Earth has tilted, causing the Arctic to recieve less sunlight. Less sunlight caused the Arctic to become very cold, like we know it now. We also know from the Geologic Time reading that 11,000 years ago, when the sun was still shining down on the arctic, that is when the peat formed. How did it form? Well, plants require sunlight to survive. If the sunlight is gone, then the plants die. We know peat is made up of dead plants, because of the Peat, Permafrost, Carbon reading. So, when the plants died, they formed peat, which then got covered in snow as the arctic started freezing up. So, that's how it ended up underneath the surface. But how has it not decomposed? It hasn't decomposed because if it doesn't receive oxygen, it can't decompose, which we know from the Oxygen and Decomposition sheet. And it hasn't been receiving oxygen, because it's been trapped underneath the surface of the Arctic. Therefore, it's been decomposing much, much slower than it would with lots of oxygen. Finally, how does this loop back to zombie fires? Well, when fires happen in the Arctic, it melts the permafrost, exposing peat, which we know from the tilt model. We also know from the yeast model that when the peat is warmer, it releases more carbon dioxide, which causes it to decompose more, and therefore let out the fires it's retaining, because we learned from the Burning Fuel Samples sheet that peat retains fire for very long time. So, bringing all of this together, the fires that happen in the Arctic burn, then get retained in the peat. They then burn the peat, causing carbon dioxide to be released, causing the peat to decompose. The peat then retains the fire again, and so on. So, there was enough matter and energy in the system for a zombie fire to burn under ice because the peat holds the energy of the zombie fire for a long time, causing it to very slowly decompose due to little oxygen.","If the temperature on Earth continues to rise, then the permafrost will continue to melt, exposing the peat to oxygen, causing it to decompose, which eventually will cause the zombie fires to stop, due to there being nothing to retain the zombie fires for long periods of time.",2,"To strengthen your response, consider organizing your explanation more clearly by breaking it into distinct sections that address each part of the question separately.

"There was enough energy and matter the system for zombie fires because of the Earth's greater tilt 11,000 years ago. We learned in ""Geologic Time "" that the Earth had a tilt (the angle a line from the North and South poles that the Earth orbits around) of 24.5 degrees. The Arctic was able to have greater solar radiation at the time because of this. So the Arctic got more sunlight, also known as energy. Plants in the Arctic were able to grow and die at normal rates like they do nowadays. But as the Earth's tilt progressivly shrank, peat and permafrost froze formed over the course of time. Peat is formed by dead vegetation (glucose) and carbon that has fused together. The peat has a thick layer of permafrost covering it and unable to let any oxygen reach the peat. Removing the abitlity for it to decompose, but then came climate change. Climate change and global warming has now let the permafrost melt as it's getting too hot for it to stay frozen for much longer. And with it, it's released oxygen to the peat. Allowing it to slowly decompose more than it already has been. The carbon is able to produce energy with the warmth in the air and create fires. During the colder seasons the fire remains in the peat, and the permafrost freezes again trapping the heat beneath in the peat. This is what's known as zombie fires. We learned in the ""Burning Demo"" that because of the plant matter and energy from the carbon inside, the fire is able to stay alive for a long time. Even though it doens't have a ton of oxygen. During our ""Burning Demo"" even after the 10 minutes we had the 3 fuels burn, the peat was still burning at a consistent rate even for how small the piece was. The yeast lab we did in class taught us that the celluar respiration works in a warm temperature in which the peat can also use to burn. So as the the peat burns, it's also allowing more of the peat to brun below the permafrost because it's creating heat and energy that the peat can catch fire from. ","If the temperature on Earth continues to rise (which it will), the peat will burn more. I know from personal research that the Earth will keep getting hotter because of climate change. As the Earth continues to get hotter. The permafrost that is covering the peat will melt quicker, exposing the peat to more oxygen. The oxygen interacting with the peat will allow it to burn more, because of what learend in the yeast lab. We learned in the yeast lab that; ""the more oxygen that fire (the yeast) has, the more the fire will burn."" So in the future, as the planet proceeds to get hotter, I predict the peat will burn and create stronger fires than what we see today.",2,"To improve your response, consider organizing your explanation more clearly to enhance readability and emphasize connections.

"Zombie fires exist becuse of the carbon and suger dense peat under the permafrost, a frozen layer of soil. Peat is a substaince made from plant life that has not decomposed, becuse of the enviorment of the artic demcompositon is harder, as seen in our experiments. the first experiment was the yeast experement where we used yeast, suger, and water to simmulate decomposition, the test was experimenting with 3 diffrent tempetures of water to see how much carbon was released within the form of bubbles, the highest amount of bubbles was at high heats with 2 inches of bubbles compared to room temp that only got .5 and cold that got.2 this shows that decompostition happens faster the higher the heat is. Scence the artic is exstreamly cold it makes sence that the decomposition dosent happen as fast, however peat has been around for thousands of years, so why has it not decomposed. Another factor is where peat is formed, its formed in lakes, using the oxogen experiment the less o2 somthing gets the less it decomposes, this is becuse during the decomposition proceses c6h12o6 is turned into co2 h2o and energy, however c6h12o6 is relient on o2 to turn into these products. becuse there is less oxogen under water it is near immposible for the peat to decompose. But how did all this peat form? becuse peat is suger dence it has lots of carbon, but if the artic has so little decomposition how dose the plant matter get there, this we found out during the tilt investigation lab where we predicted that the more light plants got the more photosynthisis they would do, we then intestigated this by putting plants into btb, a carbon messuring tool that already had co2 in it to see what plant would make more oxogen one under light(11million years ago), one with inderect light (today) and one with no light (control). This exsperiment investigated if the slight change in earths tilt could be responsible for this, and surly enough the one with the most light did the most photosyitasis this tells us how peat was able to form with so much carbon and suger. With this all in mind the zombie fires can burn on this carbon dense peat for long time, these fires melt the permafrost and let co2 get to the peat making a chemicle reaction that releases lots of energy for the fire to burn with. ","If tempetures continue to rise the artic permafrost will begien to melt exposing a huge carbon sink, the peat filled with carbon. when the fire burns the peat this carbon will escape into the atmosfire poluting the skys faster then we can. increasing the tempeture evan more.",4,"To improve your response, consider organizing your writing to make the connections between evidence and claims clearer.

There was enough matter and energy in the system for a zombie fire to burn under ice because of the peat. Peat is s carbon based plant material that is made of long chains of sugars that has been under the permafrost for many years. Peat is made by dead vegitation pilling up at the bottom of a body of water slowly compacting and only decomposing very slowly. In the past the earth was at a greater tilt causing there to be more sunlight in the arctic however now there is a lesser tilt making sure there is less sunlight. Zombie fires are fueled by peat which is very dense due to the time it took to create it. As a directional hypothesis you would expect the peat to produce smoke/CO2 which is an example of chemical energy ( how atoms are arranged or rearranged when energy is made ) which is shown when it inputs oxygen and outputs carbon dioxide. Which is how we know that zombie fires had enough matter/energy to burn under fire and ice because we know that from our burn lab the peat burned the longest and made the most CO2 which is an indicator of energy being made.,"If the temperature on Earth continues to rise there will be more zombie fires. There will be more zombie fires because the permafrost will melt, exposing the peat. Compared to 11,000 years ago there was a greater tilt of 24.5 causing  more solar radiation relating to more photosynthesis, however now there is a lesser tilt of 22.1 causing less sunlight. Because there is less sunlight plants are no longer able to grow or decompose ensuring that the peat stays unable to decompose. But if the temperature continues to rise peat will be exposed to the fires causing them to burn longer. In addition to more zombie fires there will also be more polution. There will be more polution because when glucose/peat is burned it produces energy but along with the energy is CO2 which polutes or air and because of a lesser tilt there will be less plants going through photosynthesis and producing oxygen.

"In the past , the arctic was differnt than today because the tilit of the earth .

At the time 11,000 years ago because of the tilit of the earth the sun had direct light on artic ares , meaning that plants can get broke down and become peat and peat is a fuel you can use for a fire . In class we did a lab with 3 tubes tube A was in direct light and tube B was indirect light and tube C had no light at all and we had a plant in each one . In tube the BTB soultion turn from a a green color too a blue color showing us that photosyntheis was going on tube a turn from a green color too a hint of blueish color showing littel photosynthesis was going but tube C with no light had no change in color and stayed green , This helps us solve are question of why is there enough of energy in the sytem because 11,000 years when direct light was on the plants casuing it too go throug photosyensis making oxygen and sugar . And when it broke it down it became peat and all that enrgy it produced from photosyenis 11,000 years ago stayed in the peat . That lab help show us why the light and earth tilt is imporant .

"There was enough matter and energy in the system for a zombie fire to burn under ice because of the earths tilt and photosynthesis. We learned that peat is formed from plants sumerged in water that has not decomposed. We also learned that the greater the angle of tilt, the more direct solar radiation the Artic gets. 11,000 years ago the Artic angle of tilt was 24.5 degrees and now the angle of tilt is 22.1 degrees. This means 11,000 years ago plants were growing, dying, and forming into peat through the process of photosytenshis. In the Tilt Investigation lab, the tube that had direct light realsed the most oxygen. We found this out because the BTB turned blue. The tube that had no sunlight, stayed yellow. For photosynthesis to work, the inputs are oxygen, water and light. The output of photosythensis is sugar. The reason peat doesn't go through photosythesis anymore or decompose is because the Artic doenst get the same amount of sunlight it did 11,000 years ago. Another reason the peat doesnt decompose or go through photosynthesis is because of the lack of oxygen. When the peat is trapped under the permafrost, it dosnt come in a lot of contact with oxygen. The matter and energy stored benath the permafrost is sugar (glucose). In the Burning Fuels Demo the peat burned the longest and producded the most carbon dioxide. We know this because the difference of mass was 3 grams which means the peat turned into gas (carbon dioxide) This also helps to understand how peat can burn under permafrost. When peat burns under then permafrost, it causes the permafrost to start to thaw. The peat then is exposed to oxygen which makes the fire bigger. The bigger the fire, the more carbon dioixde realesed. This also realses energy. This is how the energy flows into and out of the zombie fire system.","If the temperature on Earth continues to rise, it will help the permafrost melt. When the permafrost melts, it will expose the peat to more oxygen and this will cause more fires. If more fires occur, the more carbon dioxide will be realeased because peat is a carbon sink.

"There is enough matter and energy in they artic system fire to burn under ice due too the diffrence in the the light (energy), and how the oxeygen amounts affected decomposition. Firstly, the artic tilt was specifically 24.5 degrees 11,000 years ago, creating more room for light, compared to now when there is 22.1 degrees. This 2.4 degree diffrence in the artic tilt makes a large diffrence in the amount of photosynthesis happening. This happens because when the tilt was wider, there was more sun, meaning more light, which plays a large role in photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is ""The chemical reaction by which plants produce food (sugar/glucose) and oxeygen using enery from the sun, carbon dioxide, and water."" - our personal vocab list. This indicates that the amount of light also known as energy in the case of photsynthesis allowed more plants to thrive in the artic. This connects to another lab we did, which works hand in hand with thise one to create outstanding evidence. The lab we did to work with this was the A, B, and C, lab where each tube had a diffrence in the amount of light being sourced. Where tube A had direct light, B had indirect light, and C had no light at all. They were all filled with some parsley throughout our lab, and we took notes of the color of the BTB change. All of them satrted out wiht a blueish green, maybe with a tint of yellow. Later on, a day later, we saw how the BTB in the tube A (Direct light) had turned blue, this means that the parsley  had photosynthesis because the BTB only changes on the amount of carbon dioxide being released. Which in the case of photsyenthesis, carbon dioxide is an input (meaning it is used to create photosynthesis) and oxeygen is the output of carbon dioxide. Compared to the others, specifically tube C (No light) It turned yellow. This is due to the fact that no photosynthesis was happening and carbon dioxide was being forced to stay inside of the parsely, turning the BTB around it yellow. This works together in the favor of how areas with less light commit to less photosynthesis, and this relates to the earths artict tilt, and how we now have less of a tilt (22.1 degrees) allowing for less light, meaning less photsynthsis. Both of those pieces of evidence play a part in how photosyntheis was not happening, without photosynthesis, the plants would have never even been here, and these two reasons are what put the matter and energy in the peat, in order for energy to be stored and not able to be burned. Lastly the oxeygen significantly impacted how all of the plant materials in the plant have staued under ground, holding large amounts of matter and energy. On the Oxeygen and Decomposition worksheet, there was a grapgh, showing how diffrent amounts of exeygen affect the rate of decomposition. The jar with no additional oxeygen, had about 60% of plant matter left over 125 days, when the jar with the high additinal oxeygen amount added dropped rapidly, and at the end of the 125 days it only was 10% plant matter. These diffrences are large, with a 50% diffrence in the amount of plant matter. We can conclude the oxeygen based off of this evidence shows how the amount of oxeygen largely changed the amount of decomposition. This relates to the claim because it is common knowledge that in peat, there is very small amounts of oxeygen, and also the fact that everything is frozen there, with water being lessss than 1% oxeygen, we know that the aount of oxeygen changes the amount of rate of decomposition. In the artic the oxeygen is low in the peat, creating a longer to decompose and containing more matter than something that has lots of acess to oxeygen, not hidden and above ground.","I believe that if the eaths temprature will continute to rise, in the future peat will burn more, due to the fact of the heat difference. I think that the heat will produce more longer lasting fires in the peat, and when winter comes around, it will continue to creat large zombie fire scars, and cause destruction in the artic at a more alaraming rate. I also believe that as a reprocussion or consequence of this, our eath will have way more carbon dioxide emmisions, because in the proccess of cellular respiration, an output is always carbon dioxide, and in the case of peat burning, carbon dioxide levels will rise super high because they are hidden from the light alot, meaning they store more carbon dioxide because they can't go through the proccess of photosynthesis.",3,"While your response includes valuable information, it would benefit from a clearer organization.

"Zombie fires can burn under ice because of the energy and matter in peat. Peat is made up of dead plants compounded together, which is also sugar. Over thousands of years dead plants fall into a body of water and start making layers to then form together to create peat. Eventually the peat will fill up the entire body of water. The layer of perfamfrost keeps the fire frozen underground during the winter, but since the peat is trapped underground the fire starts to burn the peat. The fire can burn because of the matter and energy stored in peat, and when preat burns it realeases carbon dioxide. In the decomposition investigation with yeast it shows how peat can burn for so long in the cold arctic temparetures. When the yeast is in warmer water it will start to create more foam (carbon dioxide and water). I know this because in the data table for the beaker it shows that after 1 minute there was 0.15cm of foam and after 18 minutes there was cm of foam. While in the cold beaker after 1 min there was still 0 cm and at 18 minutes there was about 0.3cm. That is obviously a huge difference between the two being 2.7cm apart from each other. This is showing that zombie fires can burn all througout the winter under the icy ground because it takes longer for things to decompose in cold temperatures than warm ones, so if the peat is trapped under permafrost and in the arctic it will not decompose very fast, but it will still be burning releasing matter and energy for the zombie fires to continue to burn under ice. Another class activity that shows how zombie fires can continue to burn under ice with enough matter and energy is the tilt investigation. This shows that when you have direct light there will be more photosynthesis then when you have no light at all. The test tube that was put directly under the light had the BTB change colors from yellow to blue, while the beaker with no light did not change colors at all it stayed yellow. Which means that test tube A produced oxygen. This relates to peat and zombie fires because when the fire is underground it starts to burn the permafrost, which then brings more oxygen to the peat which causes the fire to be bigger. And when the fire burns it is making carbon dioxide, and this is all creating energy. So when there is photosynthesis happening creating oxygen that is also like peat getting more oxygen which causes the fires to be bigger and have enough matter and energy to burn. ","If the temperatures on earth continue to rise then there will be zombie fires. If the temperatures start to rise then permafrost will start to melt which will lead to more oxygen goign to the peat. If there is more oxygen exposed to the peat then it will cause the fires to be bigger and spread over more land. This will cause more carbon dioxide to be in the air, and it could spread all across the world leading to bad air quality it might make breathing very difficult. So basically my prediciton for the furture is if there is inputs of warmer temperatures there will be outputs of carbon dioxide and more fires leading to bad air quality and more zombie fires.

"Zombie fires were such a mystery for years. With people thinking these massive wildfires just died out, when really their theory was completly wrong. What really happens behind the scenes of a zombie fire is during the spring and summer the wildfire will destroy all of the vegatation that encounters it. Then when is begins to get colder the fire will then burrow in to the ground feeding on peat for energy to keep burning. Now this might get you wondering, what is peat? Well peat is dead plant matter that formed and hardened over the course of 1,000 years. These plant matter clumps typicly formed over water replacing the water with a now hard compact matter of nutriants perfect for sustaining the zombie fires. This creates a large amount of chemical energy because so much energy can be dispersed form the peat. Now 1,000 years is a long time, enough time for many things to break down and decompose. So then why doesent peat decompose? Because peat primarly forms in the arctic a very thick cold layer of ice called permafrost will freeze over the peat preserving it for years. But why is permafrost able to preserve things for long periods of time. Take dinosaurs for example, dinosaur fossils are millions of years old and yet they are preserved because either they are so far down into the earth that the O2 cant reach it or its frozen by permafrost.  Well like one of the experiments that we made in class with the yeast temperture the cold one had the least bubbles standing at about one fourth of an inch giving it the least energy. Its the same case with permafrost but it also is restricing the O2 that can reach the peat slowing down the decompistion rate greatly. This relates to zombie fires because zombie fires are so hot that it is acually able to melt down the permafrost to a state where the peat is able to supply the fire with nutriants. The reason this didnt happen millions of years ago was because the earths tilt had the artic pointed more towards the sun so their was no permafrost that could be formed because it was warmer. Reasoning for this was the documented sheet of paper we got called geologic time explained the earth present tilt being 22.1 when long ago it was 24.5. ",if the global warming problem continues to rise it could start to melt glacers in the arctic causing sea levels to rise. However another problem that could acour is it could affect the rate of photosynthesis. This could be a problem because it could decline the vegetation heavily. One last big problem that could acour is relating back to the zombie fires the heat would dry out the vegetation making them a much easeir targets for wildfires in general. also reducing the rate of decompisition greatly.,1,"To enhance your response, consider organizing your answer more clearly by using the sentence starters provided.

For instance, when talking about permafrost and its preservation abilities, directly link it back to how this supports the sustainment of zombie fires. This will help create a more cohesive explanation that ties your evidence back to your claims more clearly. Lastly, be sure to proofread for spelling and grammar errors to ensure clarity, such as correcting 'completly' to 'completely' and 'acually' to 'actually.'","You've done an excellent job of explaining the concept of zombie fires and connecting it to the class activities. You clearly articulate that 'during the spring and summer the wildfire will destroy all of the vegetation that encounters it' which shows a good understanding of how zombie fires maintain themselves. Your explanation of peat as 'dead plant matter that formed and hardened over the course of 1,000 years' demonstrates a well-researched understanding of the matter in the system. Additionally, you referenced the yeast temperature experiment from class effectively, stating 'the cold one had the least bubbles standing at about one fourth of an inch giving it the least energy,' which shows you are making connections between class experiments and the scientific concepts you're discussing."
"There is enough energy and matter in the system for zombie fires to burn unde the ice because of the way that peat is formed and how peat can store energy. Peat is made from dead plants that are compacted and is found in wet marshy areas like under lakes which means there is low oxygen causing it to compact together. Dead plants are made of C6H12O6 which is sugar which is also energy. Zombie fires are able to burn in peat because the peat is so compacted which means it is storing the heat for example when we burned peat, wood, and leaves the peats starting temp was 72.7 degrees and the ending temp was 77.2 degrees compared to the wood which starting temp was 72.5 degrees ending at 73.6 degrees. This information is telling us that compared to the wood it got the hottest out of all the burning samples we used. Peat also had the longest burning time between the wood and the leaves. So not only did it burn the longest it was also the warmest which means throughout the seasons it can hold the fires heat and be able to keep the heat in for long periods of time for example it can keep in the heat for throughout the winter until it is spring or summer time. Also the peat doesn't decompose which means it will stay in the state under the perfrost for long periods of time. The reason being when there is not a lot of oxygen or none and the temperatures are low which is how it is in the artic under the permafrost.Also when you have less input which is oxygen it means there will be less output which would be CO2. One way I know this is because in class we did a lab where we had 3 beakers A beaker was warm B was room temp and the C beaker was cold. The point was in what temperature would we have the most CO2 after we mixed water, sugar, and yeast. When we started they all had Ocm every two minutes we would record how much foam was produced. Out of all of the beakers the warm was having the most progress. Beaker A which was the warm beaker had around 2 cm of foam by the end of the lab and beaker B the room temp had around 1 cm. By the end Beaker C made little to know change staying around 0cm. This is telling us since there is no composition because the artic and peat is also under the permafrost this is telling us that the fire has more time to be in the peat.","If future temps continue to rise that means that there will be more peat forming and that could possibly cause more Zombie Fires. Peat can store energy because it is so compacted because it is made in areas with low oxygen. Peat is made of dead plants on the bottom of wet and marshy areas. In a lab we burned peat, leaves, and wood. The peat burned the longest out of the three and also got the hottest. It started at 72.7 degrees and ended at 77.2 degrees while the wood for example started at 72.5 degrees and ended at 73.6 degrees. This information from the lab is telling us that not only does it hold in the peat the longest but it's also holds the most heat compared to the wood. So if the temperatures continue to rise that means the more heat peat can hold which can also cause more fires. If the earths temperature continues to rise it can cause many issues also because there will be more plants through photosynthesis that also means there will be more oxygen. Oxygen plays a big part in any type of fires so the more the temperature rises the more fires that could happen in the future.",3,"To enhance your explanation, consider organizing your response more clearly by breaking it into distinct sections that correspond to the assignment's criteria. For instance, you could have a section explicitly addressing how peat forms and another on why it doesn't decompose. This will make it easier for readers to follow your argument. Additionally, while you did mention the yeast/decomposition lab, make sure to clearly connect how this lab illustrates the processes of decomposition and how it supports your claim about peat not decomposing under permafrost conditions. Finally, ensure your writing is concise by avoiding repetition, such as when you discuss the heat retention of peat in several different ways. This will help streamline your explanation and make it more impactful.","You have done a commendable job of explaining how peat is formed and why it contributes to zombie fires.

"I have evedince thatartic was in a different condition. When we learned about how 100,000 years ago, there was a lot more plants around and alive because the earth had a tilt 4.4 degress greater then it is now, alowing the Artic to have more sunlight, the plants used this sunlight to do photosynthesis, this photosynthesis created more Oxygen to be preduced. We know this because we conducted another lab, ""Tilt investegation"" to see if the tilt of the earth really caused a change in the amout of O2/plants. We put plants into jars, those jars were storde in different areas, one under direct light and one near light the other compleatly in the dark. all of theise tubes had BTB in them, a substince to mesuer the amount of CO2 near it, it the begging each tube was Yellow. indecating that there was CO2 in the surroundings. after a entire day, the tubes had changed color, the first tube under the light changed the most back to blue which means there is more Oxygen then Carbon Dioxcide. The other tubes with less light had less of a change and were still greenish yellow, meaning those plants didnt produce as much O2. this shows that the direct sunlight 100,000 years ago was able to produce more oxygen then it is able to now. The tilt cause this change because there is less light so all the plants that got that sunlight started to die off so there is less plants and they started to die and became peat, peat is formed by dead vegitation falling into a marsh then it is compacted and made into peat over 1000 years. since peat is formed in water and water has significantly less Oxygen in it the peat became very dence. and this means it last longer to burn since there is more sugar in the peat then there is in the vegitation still growing. plants store sugar in their systems to keep them alive, so when they fell into the marsh, the plants still had that energy and since the water has less O2 there was more opportunitys for vegitation to become solid peat insted of airy peat. after it is hardened there was colder tempatiers caused by the smaller tilt this created a sucure permafrost locking the peat into the ground. the zombie fires had been heatingand melting this frozen layer of ground making it eaisier to burn the peat. while the peat burns it causes CO2 to be relised. we saw this while we were burning peat, sticks, and leaves in the back of the class. the burning of peat caused CO2 to be prodused we useed BTB to tell us if there was CO2 made and reliseed into the air as a form of energy. the energy came from the sugar the dead plants prodused way back 100,000 years ago. theres so much peat in the artic because the tilt changed the amout of sunlight getting to the artic and this killed many plants and created peat this peat is still here because it was cagged away under the permafrost and the fires could not reach it when it got warmer th permafrost started to melt exposing the peat, thats why it is starting to produse carbon dioxsiced. the zombie fires can only burn under the ground because the peat is locked under the permafrost and it is so dense because of how its formed in water.","I perdict that in the future, if the earths tempature continues to rise the permafrost that locked the peat in the ground will continue to thaw, causing the peat to burn and the Carbon dioxcid to polute the oxygen. if the oxygen has too much CO2 in the air the air gets hard to breath and inhabitants like animals and humans will be affected because it will hurt their lungs.

"Zombie Fires can burn under the ice because of the amount of O2 that continues to feed the fire in the winter, and the cellular respiration that continues convert (input) glucose from the Peat (dead plants+glucose) into (output) energy+CO2+H2O. Peat is formed from dead plants (that have glucose in them) that decomposed over thousands of years. Over the years, a thick layer of permafrost has formed on top of the peat. Permafrost is a permanently frozen layer of ice. The fire performs Cellular Respiration (The proccess by which living things convert glucose/sugar into energy, CO2, and H2O) to the Peat which is why there is so much energy, CO2, and H2O in the Peat. We know this because of the Yeast Lab. In this lab the yeast (living thing) was fire, and the sugar was the Peat. Becuase of the combination of the two, bubbles were formed (carbon dioxide). Peat was able to form under the permafrost because in the past (11,000 years ago) the Earth's Tilt was greater. We learned through the Tilt Investigation that the more tilt meant more solar radiation. In order to show how this would affect photosynthesis, we put pieces of parsley in three tubes filled with BTB (a solution that changes color based on the amount of oxygen) and set them under 3 different amounts of light. When put under direct light, the BTB changed from Green to Blue. This meaning that there was enough oxygen to change the color significantly. When put under indirect light the color change was very insignificant, and when put under no additional light, there was no change. This chemical reaction is a display of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is chemical reaction by which plants convert light, CO2, and H20 (input) into glucose and O2 (output). So when the BTB in the direct light turned blue, it showed that there was the most O2 released, which means the photosynthesis in that tube was the greatest out of all the tubes. In the past, the arctic had a tilt of 24.5 degrees, which made there be more photosynthesis, which is why their is so much matter and energy inside of the Peat. But how has it not decomposed? Peat hasn't decomposed in the permaforst for two reasons. One reason is becuase of the amount of oxygen. With no oxygen able to reach the peat becuase of the thick permafrost, there won't be enough decomposition. In the Oxygen and Decompostion packet, there is a graph that has an explanation for concentration of oxygen. On that graph there are 4 different lines, each representing a different concentration of oxygen. They arll start out with around 80-85% plant matter. After just about 50 days the line with no additional oxygen only had a 10% decrease and stayed around 70% plant matter. Whereas the line with high additional oxygen went down to 25% plant matter, a difference of almost 50%. This connects back to the rate of decomposition of peat under the permafrost becuase the peat doesn't get additional oxygen becuase it is under the permafrost. When a Zombie Fire is formed, the Peat starts to burn. In Spring and Fall, it burns above ground, but in Winter it goes back beneath the surface. In order for the fire to continue to burn under the ice, oxygen must reach the fire to keep it going. With how hot the fire is, it starts to melt the permafrost, which then exposes the Peat to an increased amount of oxygen. Oxygen then makes the fire bigger which releases more CO2 and energy. Zombie Fires can burn under the ice because of the amount of O2 that continues to feed the fire in the winter, and the cellular respiration that continues to convert the glucose from the Peat (dead plants+glucose) into energy+CO2+H2O. ","According to the Model that we made, when temperature goes up, permafrost melts, which gives more room for oxygen to be released to the peat. More oxygen means a bigger fire, which means more zombie fires and bigger fires. Bigger fires means more CO2 released into the air which will make the cycle continue to go on forever. The continuation of the rise in the Earth's tilt will also make the temperature get hotter and provide more and more solar radiation (sun).",,"To enhance clarity and organization in your explanation, consider breaking down your response into more distinct sections. For example, you could separate different parts of your response with subheadings, such as 'Formation of Peat,' 'Role of Cellular Respiration,' and 'Impact of Permafrost and Oxygen.' This will help readers follow your argument more easily. Additionally, ensure that you're directly connecting each piece of evidence to your main claim. For instance, when discussing the Oxygen and Decomposition packet, explicitly link how the lack of oxygen under permafrost prevents decomposition, reinforcing why peat remains available as a fuel source for fires. Finally, while your details are comprehensive, strive for conciseness by focusing on the most relevant points to your claim.","Your explanation of how zombie fires can burn under ice is well-developed and thorough. You effectively use evidence from class activities, such as the Yeast Lab, to illustrate cellular respiration and its role in the burning of peat. For instance, you state, ""In this lab the yeast (living thing) was fire, and the sugar was the Peat. Because of the combination of the two, bubbles were formed (carbon dioxide),"" which effectively connects the lab to the concept of cellular respiration in zombie fires. Additionally, your use of the Tilt Investigation to explain the historical formation of peat is insightful. You mention how the Earth's tilt impacted solar radiation and photosynthesis, which is a strong use of class evidence to support your claim."
"How is there enough matter and energy in the system for a zombie fire to burn under ice? Peat is the reason zombie fires can burn under ice for so long. the matter of peat is dead plants that have formed over hundreds and thousands of years which have glucose/sugar, containing Carbon dioxide, Oxygen, and hydorgrn. One examples from the Tilt investigation is, In order for a fire to last it needs oxygen and when peat burns it creates energy which melts the permafrost and exposes peat to oxygen. This shows that when peat is exposed to oxygen it causes peat to burn longer. Another example from the Burning fuels Samples is, Peat energy and matter before was 72.7 and 0.5, wood and leaves energy and matter was 72.5, 72.3 and 0.5. After the lab the matter and energy for peat was 77.2 and 0.2 compared to the wood and leaves there matter and energy was 73.6, 73.4 and 0.4, Some observations I mad was that the Peat burned longer than the wood and leaves. This evidence shows that peat burns the longest but loses more matter which goes onto my next explanation on why zombie fires burns under ice. Peat lasts long under ice becuase of decompositons. Decomposition is when energy and matter is realesed back into the atmosphere, in order for decomposition to happen it needs oxygen and a warm atmospere to work which can't really happen when peat is under permafrost, another reason peat can't decompose is because peat is made up of water and water has low oxygen level. This shows why it's hard for peat to decompose which causes peat to last under the permafrost and peat can burn for a long time with the help of being exposed to oxygen. this shows why zombie fires can burn under ice.","What will happen in the future if temperatures continue to rise? If temp goes up permafrost will melt which will expose more peat to oxygen and peat will start decaying and releasing Carvon dioxide into the atmosphere. some evidemce from Geologic Time article is, ""Currently, the tilt of the Earth is 23.5.When the plants the formed the pea were growing, the Earth was tilted 24.5. This mean that the Artic expirienced more solar radiation for a loonger period of the year, so the Earth got more direct sunlight and therfore more energy"". this evidence shows that when the tilt was bigger the more photosynthesis happend. Photosynthesis is when a plant realese oxygen into the atmosphere. In order for photosynthesis to happen it needs light, carbon dioxide anmd water, photosynthesis relaeses sugar, oxygen. so with more photosynthesis happening that means there will be more solor radiation which also means permafrost will mealt which will cause peat to be more exposed to oxygen and fires need oxygen to survive. This all means that if temps rise there will be more zombie fires.",,"To improve your response, consider organizing your writing more clearly by breaking down your explanation into distinct parts. For instance, you could start with how peat is formed, move on to explain why it doesn't decompose, and finally, describe how these factors contribute to zombie fires. Additionally, make sure to clearly connect each piece of evidence back to your main claim. For example, after discussing the 'Burning fuels Samples' lab, explicitly state how this supports the idea of peat burning longer and contributing to zombie fires. This will help strengthen the connections between your evidence and your claims, as required by the task criteria.","You have done a great job incorporating specific evidence from class activities, such as the 'Tilt investigation' and the 'Burning fuels Samples' lab. Your detailed explanation of how peat forms from dead plants over time and contains glucose/sugar is very informative. You’ve clearly explained how the presence of oxygen is crucial for peat burning and how it contributes to the longevity of zombie fires under ice, which aligns well with the assignment criteria."
"Zombie fires can burn under the ice because of the matter and engergy stored in the peat. Peat is made up of thousands of years of dead plant matter. In fact, this peat was formed roughly 11000 years ago. Back then, the arctic was different to how it is today because of the Earth's tilt, or the angle that the Earth is at that causes seasons. According to the Geologic Time article, the tilt 11000 years ago was 24.5 degrees wheras now it measures 22.1 degrees. That is a 2.4 degree difference. The higher degree meant that the arctic faced the sun more than it does today, causing there to be warmer temperatures there. Not only did this affect temperature, but it also affected the amount of solar radiation that the arctic got. In the Tilt Investigation Lab, there were three test tubes filled with BTB. BTB is a solution that turns yellow-green when exposed to carbon dioxide and turns blue when it is exposed to oxygen. Each test tube had yellow-green BTB to start and one piece of parsley each. Each tube was then placed under a different amount of light. One was under direct light, one under indirect light, and the last one was allowed no light at all. Photosynthesis is how plants turn carbon dioxide and light into energy and matter that the plant can use. After 24 hours, the tubes were checked to see if the BTB color had changed because it was predicted that photosynthesis is represented by this equation: CO2 + light + H2O -> C6H12O6 + O2. This means that in order to produce oxygen and energy in the form of sugar (C6H12O6) or glucose, plants need light, carbon dioxide, and water. The tube that was under the direct light was a very blue color while the ones that had no light or indirect light had not changed much if at all. The blue color meant that oxygen was produced, which was one of the outputs, or results, of the chemical equation that was predicted. This shows that more sun or light (solar radiation) caused there to be more energy stored in the plants. Since peat is made from dead plants, and those plants were alive when there was more sun, it can be concluded that they had a lot of stored energy due to the higher amount of solar radiation. That energy is still inside the peat today, which is one of the reasons why there is enough energy and matter for zombie fires to burn under ice. Another reason why there is so much matter is because the peat decomposes very slowly, if at all. This is because of the lack of oxygen. In the Oxygen and Decomposition model, there were beakers with different amounts of oxygen and some plant matter with decomposers. After 125 days, it was conluded that the beaker with the highest concentration of oxygen decomposed the most. It started with 86% plant matter and after 125 days, it had been only 12 % plant matter while the other beakers had less of a drastic change. Since the beaker with the most oxygen had the most decomposition occur, it can be concluded that in order for decompostion to occur, oxygen is needed. This shows why so much peat has not decomposed because peat is sealed in a thick layer of permafrost, or permanently frozen, and this does not allow the peat to be exposed to oxygen. Without oxygen, peat can't decompose, which is another reason why there is so much peat still in the arctic after 11000 years. Fire needs fuel, and the dead plants that peat is made of fuel the zombie fires. The reason that zombie fires burn all winter underneath the ice is because there is a lot of stored energy in the plants from when they were alive, and there are a lot of dead plants since they haven't decomposed.","If the temperature on Earth continues to rise, there will be more decompostion of peat. This is because higher temperatures could cause the permafrost to melt, exposing peat to more oxygen, which fires need to burn and peat needs to decompose. According to the Oxygen and Decomposition model, the reason that peat doesn't decompose is because it is not exposed to oxygen. There were 4 beakers and it was discovered that after 125 days, the beaker with the most added oxygen had the most decomposition occur since the percent of plant matter went from 86% to 12% (a 74% difference). If peat is exposed to oxygen, not only will peat begin to decompose, but it will also allow fires that occur whether or not peat is decomposing to have more fuel. According to the zombie fire model we made in class, the zombie fires burn under the permafrost during the winter. Since there is not much oxygen in the peat (it was formed in water and water doesn't have much oxygen) the fires only smolder, but if the peat was exposed to oxygen, then there could possibly be full fires in the winter, not just smolders, which would deplete the amount of peat in the arctic. Additionally, warmer temperatures would make it possible for decomposers like bacteria to start to break down the peat through cellular respiration. In the yeast lab, there were three beakers that had three different temperatures of water: warm, room temperature, and cold. Eac beaker had yeast and sugar added in order to perform cellular respiration. According to the cellular respiration equation, C6H12O6 + O2 -> CO2 + Energy + H2O, carbon dioxide is produced during the chemical reaction, and this is seen in the lab through the amount of bubbles in the water. The warm beaker produced the most bubbles, meaning the most decomposition occured. This shows that with higher temperatures, peat would decompose not only from oxygen, but also through bacteria breaking it down. Since there will be oxygen, fire, and bacteria/other decomposers breaking down peat if there are warmer temperatures, therefore the Earth warming up would mean more peat decompostion.",,"To enhance the organization of your response, consider structuring your explanation into clearer sections. You could start with a brief overview, then separate your discussion of the formation of peat, the historical context of the Arctic, and the specific evidence from class activities. This will help in clearly distinguishing each part of your argument. Furthermore, while you do an excellent job explaining the process of photosynthesis, try to more explicitly connect this to how it contributes to the energy available for zombie fires—perhaps by summarizing these connections at the end of your response. This will help in ensuring that each piece of evidence is directly tied back to your main claim about zombie fires.","Your response provides a comprehensive explanation of how zombie fires can burn under ice.

"The reason why there is enought matter and energy for zomibie fires to burn is because the thing thats fueling the fire is peat. Peat is made of dead packed vegitaion that cant decompose like we learned in our Peat,Permafrost,Carbon packet. The way it started was 11,000 years ago in the artic the earth was at a diffrent tilt accoring to the Geologic time worksheet and the artic was getting more sunlight and plants were going through lots of photosynthesis growing. At some point the earths tilt moved again and the artic wasnt getting anymore sun and the plants couldnt decompose because its too cold to support any decomposers like bugs or scavangers i know this because in the yeast lab the beakers keep cold only grew 1/2 Cm in 16 mins while the warm beaker grew 3 1/2 in 16 minuites and the ice kept it packed and preserved additonaly no oxygen could get to the peat and as we learned in the OXYGEN and DECOMPOSITION packet we neeed oxygen for things to decompose because in the paper JAR A had no addititional oxygen and JAR D had high additinol oxygen and whne let sit to decompose JAR A started off at 85% plant matter and by day 100 was at around 65% plant matter compared to JAR D which started at 80% plant matter and by day 100 had only arounhd 12% plant matter remaning supporting my claim that you need oxygen to decompose.. Now back on to present day zombie fires are burnng peat which is full of energy. We know this because when peat is burned it relases smoke or CO2 in the air and we know peat produces a lot becuase in our burning lab the BTB when from light blue to a green color compared to the leaves that when burned barely relased any CO2 hence keeping thye BTB a blueish color. CO2 is the energy in the peat being relased. However the fires keep getting bigger because according to our modles when peat is burned it melts the permafrost around the peat exposing it to oxygen and exposing the fire to oxygen making the fire larger like we learned in class. The energy or sugar in the peat when exposed to O2 or oxygen relases CO2 and H2O or water. To summerize Theres enought matter and energy under ice to support zombie fires becuase it was made thousands of years agao when the earth was at diffrent tilt, plants grew throiught photosytheis in which Light, solar radiation, Co2 And H20 produces sugar and oxygen but then the earth tilted again and there wasnt as much solar radiation from the sun  and it got really cold so the pknats wwere trapped in ice with no oxygen bc we learned in classs that water has less than 1% oxygen and the thousnads of years later to wildfires and human attivitic peat got caught on fire rleasing the energy and its getting bigger becuase oxygen makes fires bigger and theres so much of it becuase it coudnt go anywhwere.",If temptures contuin to rise wildfires will increase bc accoridng to our modle warmer temptures make more co2 and the artic may falll apartand the earths tilt  could be changing again and this is why theres more fires aswell,,"To enhance your writing, focus on organizing your ideas more clearly and ensuring each piece of evidence directly supports your claims.

"Zombies fires fuel to burn is peat and peat can burn for a very long time, we know this because of our lab we did where we burned peat, leafs and wood and peat burned the longest.So how did peat form? About 11,000 years ago the arctic was different, it wasn't as cold as it was now because of the earths tilt, it was 24.5  so the arctic had more direct solar radiation but now it is 22.1 so less direct solar radiation. And peat is made out of dead plants/Glucose so back when the arctic had more direct solar radation and there was more photosyntheis for plants because an input in photosynthies is light/sun and CO2 + H2O and then the output of C6H12O6+O2, so thats how the plants formed. We tested the earths tilt and photosyntheis in class where we put there plants in BTB, which changes with the amount of O2 and CO2 its exposed too, we made the BTB yellow with CO2 first and after putting the plants in the tubes, we put one under direct light, showing the tilti 11,000 years ago, one for indircet light which shows the earths tilt today and one with no light is a control. The one with direct light turned blue which means it did photosyntheis and the one with indirect light was green ish blue which means it did little photosyntheis and the one with no light was yellow so no photosyntheis .Then once they died they fall into swamps and get very dense over centries and then as the tilt got smaller it got cold and now there is premafrost over the peat, storing all the peat and matter under it. So the Zombie fires can burned under ice because all the peat matter doesn't decompose. We know this because in our yeast lab where we did one warm, room temp. and cold tubes with C6H12O6O2 and we measured the foam which is CO2 and H2O and the one with the most foam was the warm one with 2cm and the cold one with the least 0.2cm so the peat being made of sugar(gluclose) so since the peat is under the permafrost it can decompose so that is how it has stayed there for so long and the Zombie fires can burn for so long and matter and energy is stored in peat and when Zombie fires burn it melts the permafrost releasing a lot of CO2 and energy and exposing the peat to oxygen, making the fire bigger and last longer. Plus with the peat stuck under the permafrost for a while it wasnt exposed to oxygen and oxygen also help decompose dead plants because of the Oxygen and decompostion paper where the dead plant was exposed to high additinal O2 plant matter was less than 25% after 50 days and the one with no additonal oxygen plant matter went down to only about 60 after 50 days. So that is how the Zombie fires system has enough energy and matter to burn under ice.","I think it'll get bigger and worse. Because the permafrost will melt because of the fires, exposing it to more oxygen making the fires bigger and releasing more CO2 into the air because peat is made of dead plants or gluclose and the dead plants decompose with warmer temp. and as they burn it means more CO2 released into the air.",,"To improve your response, consider organizing your points more clearly and concisely.

"The zombie fires are able to burn underground because the permafrost is supposed to be covering the peat but its not because the fire is melting the pf and thats causing the fire to be exposed to oxygen and fires feed off of oxygen. There was enough energy because peat stores energy and matter. peat is made up up dead palnts that havent decomposed so the combine and form peat.The plants were alive at a time and went through photosynthesis. the reason why peat isnt decomposing like the rest of the plants going through psn is because in our earths tilt lab we arent getting enough sun from the artic like we were 11,000 
years ago. when the plants in our demo has direct light they came out blue which meant they were going through psn. the plants need the sun to go through psn because thats oner of their inputs like their food. when the plants have the highest amount of o2 they went all the way through psn, as satesd earlier oxygen feeds fire so when the fire is brun over peat has the stored o2 this can relate to zombie fires because the oxygen stored in the peat could also be adding to the fire being able to burn for so long. The yeast lab was a good demo for showing us the process of peat and how the co2 was being released. The warmer the water was the more co2 was released. for example beaker 3 with the warm water ended up with 15mm of the foam at 20 minutes while the cold was at 0 and the roomp temp was at 13. the fire is melting the pf and releasing co2 which is a factor in climate change now and why the artic is melting. the artic is different from the past today because the tempatures have rose, the ice is melting and the suns tilt isnt the same, today its 22.1 and before it was 24.5.",I predict that the firses will get worse and the tempatures will rise and if they rise the artic will end up melting completely. the fires will get wrose when the permafrost starts to emlt and the peat will be exposed to oxygen which  is exposing the fires to oxygen and itll feed and feed and feed then eventually we wont have forestry. sobasically i think the artic will melt completely and the forests will burn and we will continue to lose rescoures to the point of no return.,,"To enhance your response, try to organize your ideas more clearly by breaking them into distinct sections or paragraphs.

"Peat is formed by dead plants being compressed under water. That water, in the arctic, is frozen under something called permafrost, which is frost that takes a lot more heat to melt then your everyday frost. Because of this, the peat stays under that permafrost for hundreds and thousands of years because it is unable to decompose due to the cold temperatures and lack of oxygen under the permafrost. In order for things to decompose, they need warmer temperatures, as demonstrated in the yeast lab. In the yeast lab we saw that yeast broke down more in warmer temperatures as opposed to cooler temperatures. In the past, the arctic was exposed to higher amounts of sunlight, which is how the plants got there in the first place. Now when we think of the arctic we think about cold temperatures with little to no sun, that's not how it was 11,000 years ago. The earth's tilt was at a higher angle exposing the arctic to more sun, making it easier for plants to survive. As demonstrated in the class experiment on photosynthesis, plants release more oxygen and produce more sugars when they're exposed to direct sunlight. When the plants died, they got turned into peat, which is still there. When the peat burns, it melts the permafrost above the peat, exposing the layer of peat to more oxygen which was lacking under the permafrost. When the fire on the peat is exposed to more oxygen, it burns more, like fanning a flame, releasing more carbon dioxide. It's a continuous cycle of the peat burning, melting pf, and releasing more co2 in smoke.","If the temperature on Earth continues to rise, the fires that are already burning, will get bigger and affect more places in the arctic and everywhere else. More plants will grow, causing more peat, causing more ammunition to burn setting the chain reaction off again.

Also, try to organize your response so that each idea flows logically into the next, which can help make your argument more cohesive and easier to follow.

zombie fires can burn under the ice because of peat thats under the ice. peat is a carbon based material that is made from dead vegitation that forms in at the bottom of water and peat is also a from of celluar respiration. the reason why zombie fires can still burn is because its getting it fuel from the peat to burn.,"if the temperture on earth continues to rise, i think that the permafrost covering the peat will start to melt and expose the peat. once peat is exposed to oxygen it could make zombie fires come back up from under peat and permafrost and make them more common and the fires could get larger and more harmful. the temperture rises because of the earths tilt. the greater angel of tilt the arctic gets more of a direct solar radiation and that leads to more photosynthisis.",,"To further strengthen your response, you might want to elaborate on why peat hasn't decomposed in the Arctic environment, possibly due to cold conditions slowing down decomposition processes, which would link nicely with the decomposition lab we did in class.

"The reason why there is so much matter and energy in the system, is because peat is present, peat is very compact and has tons of energy because it is made up of dead plants, the way the plants get this energy is through photosynthesis where the plant uses sunlight  and carbon to produce energy, oxygen, and sugar. Since there is so much energy, when burned, like everything, it realeases energy. But the way peat formed was different from today, peat formed over time in water sources roughly 11,000 years ago when the Artic was warmer, the reason the Artic was warmer was due to tilt, the time period when peat was forming had a tilt of 24.5, and the present day tilt is 22.1, which gives the Artic less solar radiation, which equals less photosynthesis and temperature in the Artic. We know it affects photosynthesis because in the Tilt Investigation Lab, we noticed that when the parsley was under direct light, it turnt blue, which means it released oxygen. The other test tubes in the lab were placed under indirect, and no light, and the test tube with indirect light still produced oxygen, but less than the one in direct light, and the final test tube that was under no light produced no oxygen, which is why we know that the tilt/sunlight affects the oxygen produced by a plant. Another example is the Decomposition Investiagtion Data and Sensmaking Lab, when we looked at the yeast, the yeast represent the plants in peat, and we figured out that when introduced to warmer temperatures, more carbon dioxide is produced, just like when platnts are introduced to warmer temperatures, they make more oxygen. We know this is true because on the final minute of the experiment, the warm beaker had 2 cm of foam, and the other beakers had 0.1 cm, which means that more carbon dioxide was produced when warm water was present, and that it was possible that the yeast/plants cannot survive in colder temperatures. Finally, to understand how it burns you need to know how zombie fires work, when zombie fires go underground for the winter, they come in contact with peat, when in contact with peat, the zombie fire now has fuel for their fire, and since peat has so much energy, it stays burning for long periods of time.","If the temperature on Earth continues to rise, then the peat will be exposed and start to decompose. In the zombie fire system, when peat comes into contact with fire, the peat is the fuel for the fire, its what keeps the fire burning because there is energy to burn, if the temperature continues to rise, then the permafrost that encloses the peat will begin to melt, which then exposes the peat to oxygen, through our Oxygen and Decomposition investigation, we figured out that when plant matter and decomposers are introduced to high additional oxygen, they decompose the most, like on the graph we can see that the high addidtional oxygen has the lowest % of plant matter, which is ~14% at 100 days, while each of the other lines that show the low, medium, and no addidtional oxygen are higher above the high additional oxygen. This proves that oxygen will affect the amount of time it takes peat/plants to decompose and how much it will decompose by. Since the peat is exposed, it is easier to burn for the zombie fires, another thing is that when something burns, it releases carbon dioxide, and carbon dioxide is pretty warm, and since theres more fire, theres more carbon dioxide which equals temperature increase. It's almost like a endless cycle because global warming affects how the peat stays cold, it then becomes exposed and vunerable to fire, and then since it's burning, the carbon dioxide heats up the atmosphere.",,"To enhance the organization and clarity of your response, consider breaking down your explanation into smaller, more focused paragraphs.

"Zombie fires can burn under ice because there is peat stored under the permafrost in the arctic. In the arctic, it is very cold, and there aren't many plants, so people wondered how zombie fires could burn under ice. 11,000 years ago, Earth had a tilt of 24.5 degrees. We learned that a bigger tilt means more direct solar radiation on the arctic in our tilt investigation. On the other hand, we also learned that with less of a tilt now, (23,5 degrees), the artic is exposed to less solar radiation, and colder. Then we did the investigation on how solar radiation affects plants and photosynthesis. In this investigation we exposed plants in BTB to different levels of solar radiation. We knew that the if the BTB turned blue, the plant was doing a lot of photosynthesis while if the BTB stayed yellow, the plant was doing hardly any. The results showed that when a plant was exposed to direct sunlight, the BTB was blue, showing photosynthesis was occuring. While the plant exposed to no solar radiation, did not have the BTB change colors, it stayed yellow. This represents how in the arctic years ago, plants could grow because it was more exposed to direct sunglight due to the tilt. Then, as the arctic cooled, the plants started dying, and decomposing. We learned through our decomposition investigation and the yeast expirament, that when plants decompose they have inputs and outputs. The inputs are sugar and oxygen, these then get turned into carbon dioxide, water, and energy. Peat is made up of dead plants, so the energy from this reaction is being stored inside the peat. How is there so much energy in the arctic then? In our yeast investigation we learned how there was so much peat that hadn't decomposed. In our yeast investigation we had colder beakers and warmer beakers. The yeast represented the decomposers and the foam was the carbon dioxide, and energy being released. We saw that in the colder beaker, there was only 0.1 centimeters of foam, while in the warm beaker, there was 2.5 centimeters of foam. This meant that in warmer surroundings, decomposition can happen faster. Although in the arctic, it was cold now, so decomposition of the peat was being slowed by the cool weather. Scientists also wanted to know if the amount of oxygen that the peat is exposed to will slow down or speed up decomposition, and they learned that it can. They had 4 jars with plant matter, one with no extra oxygen, one with low additional oxygen, one with medium, and one high.The jar with high additional oxygen had 10% plant matter left after 100 days, while the one with no additional oxygen had 60% plant matter left after 100 days. That is a 50% difference. We know that peat decomposes underwater, where it is not exposed to a lot of oxygen. This means that another reason peat has built up so much is because it was not exposed to a lot of oxygen and wouldn't decompose quickly. The energy from the peat was just being stored, and not going anywhere, so when zombie fires started burning in the peat, they could burn for a very long time using the energy from the peat that had not decomposed.","If the temperature on Earth continues to rise, there will be a lot of carbon released into the air. I believe this because peat is stored under permafrost. Since permafrost traps the peat, and stops it from decomposing, because of the cool temperature, if permafrost is gone, peat will start decomposing. If Earth's temperatures continue to rise, the arctic will start to get warmer and permafrost will start to melt. This will in turn expose the peat. Peat is made up of dead plants, which is made up of carbon. We know that when peat decomposes an output is carbon dioxide. So now there will be carbon being released into the air, and the cycle will continue if the temperatures do not go down.",,"To enhance your response, consider organizing your explanation more clearly by grouping related ideas together.

"Zombie fires can burn under ice because the peat that is trapped under the perma frost can burn because peat is made of dead plants that never decomposed which means it has trapped carbon dioxide. And since peat has trapped carbon dioxide the fire can grow larger melting the ice and make the fire grow rapid and larger. This had happend because long ago the Earth's tilt was closer to the sun meaning that the plants that peat are made of went through PSN(Photosynthesis) meaning that it produced oxygen and sugar but when it died since it was no carbon dioxide it didn't decompose which led to it having carbon built up under the perma frost which help fires burn longer and helps fires grow bigger. In a lab that we did in class we had yeast which broke down the sugar and created o2 and water which is pretty similar to peat and it showed how warmer temps help PSN comapared to colder temps. This helped because the wamer jar with yeast produced 8 cm of ""foam"" which was carbon dioxide while the cold one created no cm of ""foam"" carbon dioxide and this hsows how it is in the Artic. A different class lab which showed how PSN is determind by light/energy. We had three beakers all filled with persley and btb all were also the same color(green). We put one beaker directly under the light another one indirectly behind the light and the third one got zero light. The first beaker went through PSN and it changed to a blue type of color because of the carbon relased. The second one went throught a little less amount of PSN then the first but still went through it and it was like a lighter blue which showed it relased a tiny/medium ammount of carbon dioxide. The third one with no light didn't go through PSN and was a dark yellow this showed that no carbon was relased and that it was all built up. Now this relates to peat in the perma frost because it shows how Earth's tilt use to be 11,000 years ago which was beaker one and that it was more sunlight in the Artic.But in current day of the Artic there's little to sunlight in the Artic which was showed in the third beaker and it shows how plants can't go through PSN without the sun. And that's why the fire can grow underground due to peat having bulit up carbon dioxide.",If the temperature on Earth continues to rise the ice in the Artic will start to melt and peat will be exposed to air which will lead to more fire because of the carbon dioxide that was hidden under the ice. Peat carries the carbon that's underground which means that the peat being expose will likely cause an increase in fires and an increase in ice melted which means that the Artic will most likely be fully melted and can cause global problems.,,"To improve your response, consider organizing your points more clearly by structuring your paragraphs around specific ideas and evidence.

"Zombie fires can burn under ice becuase peat is was it burning and peat is made out of dead plant material. When the peat gets exposed to oxygen the fire gets bigger because oxygen in used as an input to energy. The permafrost also starts to melt becuase of the energy and heat caused by the fire. For example when we did burned peat in class the peat took a while for it to catch on fire, but when it did catch a flame it burned the longets because of how much matter it has and how much dense it was. Also when it was it was surrouned by oxygen it burned even longer. Also the earth tilt was at 24.5 degrees which means the more the artic gets of solar raditation. For exampke in the lab we did in class we put parsley and BTB in a tube. We had 3 tubes all together and one tube was in no light, another in indirect light, and one in direct light. The one in direct light did not changed colors because it had the most energy going to it. ",If the temperture countinues to rise there will be more zombie fires. The temper will go up becuase the more temperture means more photosythesis and solar raditaion. For example in the peat decompotion lab the cylinder with the hotter water had the most docomption because of how high the temperture. The yeast was used as peat and the yeast/peat got bigger due to the temperture of the water. The warm cylinder had 3cm worth of decompotion compared to the cold one which had only 0.5 decompition.,,"To strengthen your explanation, consider organizing your response to clearly separate the different scientific ideas you're addressing, such as peat formation, decomposition, and energy flow.

"There was enough matter and energy in the system for a zombie fire to burn under ice because in the past, the artic was different than today.In our Earth tilt model that we did in class, we see that 11,000 years ago in the Artic there used to be a greater angle of tilt comapred today, about a 2.4 difference. 11,000 years ago it had a 24.5 tilt while now, in present times, there is a lesser angle of tilt at about 22.1.     11,000 years ago, because of the greater tilt more solar radition was in the Artic and because of that more photosynthesis was occuring, but when the Artic got a lesser angle of tilt,  there less solar radition which results in little to none photosynthesis, but the peat from 11,000 years ago didnt have to chance to decompose due to the lack of oxyegn when it got colder, so all the dead plants in the Artic are not able to decompose.
We know that for photsynthesis to be able to occur, there must be sunlgiht, or solar radition, we know that because of the Tilt Investigation lab. In the lab we had 3 tubes with the same amount of C02  and the same amount of parsley in it and we put them all different places. The one where we  put under direct light had the most change where it went from green to blue which means it had the msot photosynthese and the highest amount of oxyegn, while the one we put with no light changed from green to blue meaning there was no photosynthesias occuring because there was both no light and no oxygen. These pieces of evidence tells us that photosynthesis cannot occur without both solar radition and without oxygen so in the Artic at present times, no photosybthesis is happening because there are no plamnts there, instead all of the dead plants that peat is made of did photosynbthesis 11,000 years ago but wasn't able to decompose due to the lack of oxygen from the area it was originally made of, so all the peat is decomposing slowly with a lot of matter and energy stored and all there energy is flowing into andn out of the zomebie system when it comes under for winter.","If the temperature on Earth continues to rise, I think peat is going to start decomposing. As the temperature in earth rises, the numbers of zombie fires will most likely start to increase as well which makes the temperature even warmer, in heat, permafrost will start to melt which would in turn result in peat getting exposed to oxygen. According to Oxygen and Decomposition worksheet  that the more oxygen there is, the more decomposition will occur. Over 100 days, the plant matter went from 80% all the way to around 15% while no oxygen went from 90% plant matter to 60%, the plant matter in high oxygen got smaller and eventually turned into gas so we know that decomposition occured. We  now know that the  amount of oxygen affects the rate of decomposition, so if peat gets exposed to the oxyegn, it will start to decompose faster than before",,"To enhance the clarity and organization of your response, consider breaking down your ideas into smaller, more concise paragraphs.

Finally, ensure that all scientific terms are spelled correctly, such as 'photosynthesis' and 'carbon dioxide' to enhance readability.","You've successfully incorporated evidence from the Earth tilt model and your Tilt Investigation lab to explain the phenomenon of zombie fires. For example, you mentioned that ""11,000 years ago it had a 24.5 tilt while now, in present times, there is a lesser angle of tilt at about 22.1,"" which demonstrates your understanding of how historical changes in Earth's tilt affected solar radiation and photosynthesis in the Arctic.

"There was enough matter and energy in the system for a zombie fire to burn under ice because there was lots of peat to keep the fire burning. Peat is formed by dead vegitation. 11,000 years ago in the artic the earth had a tilt of 24.5 degrees, during this time the artic got more sunlight. In class when we did the tilt modle, we discovered that more sunlight causes more photosynthesis. For exsample vile A  got the most sunlight, and vile C got the least. There was a cup of BTB in both of them. After we checked back up on them the next morning the BTB in vile A went from yellow to blue, but vile C stayed the same. This is because vile A is using the CO2 from the the BTB because it's getting enough sunlight to make photosynthesis. But vile C wasn't getting any sunlight so it couldn't make photosynthesis, so it didn't use the CO2 from the BTB. This lab showed us that the greater tilt of the artic was creating photosynthesis on the plant, and explains why the lesser tilt that gives the artic  less sunlight doesn't create photosynthesis. But we also know why the peat was able to burn creating the zombie fire according to the oxegon and decompostion worksheet from class. There were 4 diffrent jars, one with no additional oxegon, one with low  additional oxygen, one with medium additional oxygen, and one with high additional oxygen. There were also plant matter and decomposers in each. They all started out at the same about of plant matter on day 0. But as they reached the 50 day mark, the high additional oxygen was at the lowest at only 25% plant matter, whereas the others were still at 40%, 50%, and 70%. This exsperiment showed that more oxygen causes quicker decompostion. Which also explains why there was enough matter and energy in the system for a zombie fire to burn under ice, because the peat was locked in the permafrost, so it wasn't getting any oxygen. The permafrost the peat is locked into is made of water. Water only has 1% oxygen, compared to air which has 21%. So the peat had no oxygen when it was locked ito the permafrost. And without any oxygen it couldn't decompose.","If the temperature on Earth continues to rise, more fires will happen in the artic. In the oxygen and decompostion worksheet from class there was an exspirement done with 4 diffrent jars. There was one jar with no additional oxegon, one with low additional oxygen, one with medium additional oxygen, and one with high additional oxygen. There were also plant matter and decomposers in each. They all started out at the same about of plant matter on day 0. But as they reached the 50 day mark, the high additional oxygen was at the lowest at only 25% plant matter, whereas the others were still at 40%, 50%, and 70%. This exspirement showed us that more oxygen causes more decompostion. But if the Earth heats up, the peat that was locked in permafrost will now be exsposed to the oxygen outside the permafrost. The zombie fires happen because the fires melt the permafrost so they can continue burning and come back up. But if more permafrost is melted, we can conclude that there will be more fires.

"well to start peat was formed 1000's of years ago from plants and when the plants died they were underwater and formed into peat and the plants used photosynthesis to create food so they used the suns energy to make food and the fiid was sugar, they made sugar for food from the suns light/energy and peat dosent form very fast becasue it needs oxygen and its underwater and theres not a lot of oxygen underwater so it takes even longer and the production of peat is even slower now because back thousands of years ago the sun had a good angle on the artic making the sun able to reach the artic and allow plants to grow faster and better with photosynthesis but now it got a 2 degree greater tilt so the sun isnt directly on the artic now slowing down production so thats the difference of the artic from now to today so but zombie fires can burn under the ice becasue they burn during the summer and as the winter starts to come the tempatures decrease the fire never goes pput and is still burning under the ice and it burns the peat as the fuel with the little oxygen it has and when the temps rise up again the snow starts to melt enouugh where the fire/burning peat can be reintroduced to more oxygen allowing it to gow faster and bigger again after burning under the ice foor so long and it shows becasue in september 2015it shows the burn scar from the soda creek fire and it burned about 17,000 acres of land leaving huge burn scares and it wasnt fully extingished before the winter set in and was still burning under all of the ice and in april 2016 it was still burning under the ice and in late mahy the snow melted enough that the fire was meet with oxygen again and spreads even more and it burned about 57% more of the land that was not already burned and we did a labb that showed that when the tempatures are higher the peaat realses more co2 (carbon dioxide) and can cause a affect on tempature because what happened was we had 3 cup 1 had hot water 1 had cold water and 1 had room temp water and we put yeast and sugar in there and it was showing zombie fires and peat and all that and tthe old cup didnt grow any faom letting out 0 mm of co2 and the room temp cup had like 0.5-1 mm of foam and the hop cup had a lot of like 5-6 mm of foam showing the hotter it is the more co2 is being realised and adding on to the peat burning we also did anotehr lab showing how long peat can burn so we burned leaves wood and peat and the leaves were gone after 30 seconds so they dont last long the wood lasted 30 minutes lasting a bit longer but a tiny single little peice of peat lasted 8 hours of burning so that says how long a whole pond of peat can burn under the ice and it also shows that peat is a very energetic thing because fires need energy and the peat was giving enough energy to last 8 hours and the wood and leaves didnt give as much but the leaves the wood and the peat all lost some weight after burning to showing it lost energy and mass so when oxygen is flowing into the ground the co2 is being realeased that plants take and use to grow and spit out oxygen becasue when they need to grow they take co2 and leave out oxygen adding to the fires that are burning annd the last lab we did was we had green ish yellow btb which ias a blue liquid but when co2 is added it turns green and if you add alot it turns yellow and we put a leaf of parsley into a tube ad sealed it and put 1 under a light 1 under indirect light and 1 with 0 light and they were all set up the same but some had light and some didnt and the 1 under the direct light changed back to blue giving the most amount of oxygen and the indirect light was green ish blue almost blue though but the 0 light one didnt change at all still yellow showing how photosynthesis works and how plants take co2 and replaces it with oxygen",if the temps continue to rise in the artic the fires will continue to burn becasue the zombie fires go under the iuce when it gets cold but if it stays warm and theres no ice it will stay above the ice and burn even longer burning these big chuncks of permafrost keeping the temp rising and allowing the ice to melt becasue it says in spetember 2015 the fire went under the ice and burned even more peat and permafrost and late may it emerged back up from under the ice and with additional heat and oxygen it burned faster and was able to come back up after a long winter burning 57% more of the land that hasent already been,,"To enhance the organization and clarity of your response, consider breaking it into paragraphs that address each part of the question systematically. For instance, start with a paragraph dedicated to explaining how peat forms and the conditions affecting its decomposition. Then, discuss the perpetuation of zombie fires under ice with clear transitions between ideas, such as how they 'burn during the summer and as the winter starts to come the temperatures decrease.' Additionally, when you mention the lab activities, ensure to connect them clearly back to your main points. For example, when discussing the yeast and sugar experiment, clarify its relevance by stating how it demonstrates the relationship between temperature and CO2 release, which relates to the effect of warming on zombie fires.

Additionally, you link this formation to photosynthesis by stating 'the plants used photosynthesis to create food,' which is a crucial connection to the energy flow in the ecosystem."
"Zombie fires are able to burn under ice because of the large amount of Peat under the permafrost which will keep the fires burning for long periods of time. Peat is made up of dead plants that have not yet decomposed. The Peat does not decompose because only 1%  Oxygen is actually in the water, and for something to decompose, it needs oxygen. We saw this is the ""Oxygen and Decomposition"" reading. The reading showed us 4 different jars with plant matter isnide all 4. One jar got no additional oxygen, one got low aditional oxygen, one got medium additional oxygen, and the last got high additional oxygen. As the scientists in the reading tracked the jars' decomposition after 100 days, it showed how the jar with the highest ammount of additional oxygen had the most decomposition(10% plant matter left), and the jar with no additional oxygen has the least amount of decompostion(60% plant matter left). This investigation showed how the more oxygen goes into the decompostion process, the faster it will go. In the past, Earths tilt was slighly grater than it is today (from 24.5 degrees to 22.1 degrees), which is the reason why the Peat got there in the first place. There had been more solar raditaion in the arctic because of the tilt, and more solar raditaion means more photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants grow, by taking in water (H2O), light, adn Carbon Dioxide (CO2), and turning it into Oxygen (O2) and sugar or glucose (C6H12O6). The plants would need the CO2 that was made by cellular respiration to survive. We figured out in our ""Tilt Investigation or Parsley Lab"" that the more solar radiation the plants would get, the more photosynthesis would happen. We had three test tubes, all with BTB inside (a substance that helps us determin how much photosynthesis is happening) and one piece of parsley. One tube we put diresctly under light, one we put under indirect light/next to the light, and the last we blcoked out all the light for. The following day we saw that the tube that was under dirct light had turned blue (it underwent the most photosynthesis), the one under the indirect light was green (less photosynthesis) and the one with no light was yellow (it underwent very little to no photosynthesis. This shows how the more solar radiation the plants were getting, the more photosynthesis there was. Which explains how so much Peat ended up in the Arctic in the first place. Overal the CO2 in the environment whcih was made through cellular respiration would bc used in photosynthesis to help them grow, but as the tilt shifted, there was a lot less solar radiation in the Arctic. Explaining how the Peat got under the permafrost in the first place and continued to not decompose because of low Oxygen levels. The zombie fires would use the energy from the Peat to burn under the ice for long periods of time, showing that the reason they can burn under ice is due to the Peat.","If the temperatures of the Earth continue to rise, there will be larger zombie fires. This is becuase of the melting permafrost due to the already rising temperature, therfore the Peat will be expossed to more Oxygen (O2) causing for it to start to decompose and the already started fires will have more Peat to burn. So they will be realising a lot more Carbon Dioxide (CO2) causing the temperautre to rise even furthur. This would not be good whatsoever because of the large carbon Sink being released.",,"To improve your response, consider making your explanation more concise and clearly organized around the key points you want to make.

"Peat is a form of matter made in a body of water with dead plants and vegetation. The peat in the Artic was formed 11,000 years ago. According to the Earth's tilt paper, it was able to form 11,000 years ago because the Earth's tilit was 24.5 degrees, which is bigger than today's of 22.1 degrees, meaning there will be more solar radiation. This causes more photosynthesis, meaning more plants with grow, which is why peat was able to form 11,000 years ago. Peat is what the zombie fires burn from. According to our Burning Fuel Sample lab, Peat, compared to wood and leaves, was able to burn for the longest amount of time, while covered. This shows that peat can burn while being covered. However, zombie fires can burn under the ice because fire makes temperatures warmer. This then causes the permafrost, that surrounds peat and keeps it from decomposing quickly, to melt. Once the permafrost starts to melt, the zombie fires with start to get more oxygen. The more oxygen there is, the bigger the fire will get, since oxygen is an input to fire. According to the Yeast lab the colder to temperatures, the less yeast will decompose. In the lab we used yeast to represent the decomposers in peat. The yeast decomposed the glucose and made carbon dioxide, water, and energy, which were the bubbles. But as shown in the lab there weren't as many bubbles as the room temperature and warm temperature beakers. Even though this means there wouldn't be any peat for fire to burn from, causing less energy, there was just enough matter to keep the fire burning throughout winter. ","I predict that in the future is the temperature on Earth continues to rise, that the heat from it will cause permafrost to melt. This means peat will get exposed to a lot of oxygen and cause the zombie fires to grow bigger. This means more carbon dioxide with be emmitted into the atmosphere. All of this will cause global warming to increase significantly and endanger all living things on Earth.",,"To improve your response, consider organizing your ideas more clearly by explicitly stating the flow of energy and transformation of matter in the zombie fire system. For instance, when you mention ""fire makes temperatures warmer,"" connect it more directly back to the energy flow from the fire to the ice and permafrost. Additionally, ensure that your explanation of the yeast lab more clearly connects back to the decomposition processes in the peat. You mention the yeast lab but could further clarify how the conditions of the yeast lab reflect the limited decomposition in the arctic environment. Finally, reinforce your understanding by explicitly linking these processes to the concept of zombie fires burning under ice in your conclusion.","Your response shows a strong understanding of how peat is formed and its role in zombie fires. You specifically mention that ""Peat is a form of matter made in a body of water with dead plants and vegetation,"" which aligns well with the scientific explanation of peat formation. It's also commendable how you referenced the Earth's tilt paper to explain how solar radiation contributed to the formation of peat 11,000 years ago. Moreover, your use of the Burning Fuel Sample lab to support the claim that peat can burn for a long time ""while covered"" is a great example of using specific class evidence to back up your claims."
"Zombie fires can burn under ice because of peat storing that energy and heat under snow. Peat is formed by dead plants falling into water, layering itself over a span of thousands of years while still being underwater. While it is underwater it does not decompose because water has a very little, to no oxygen in it, keeping the peat from decompistion. But why is the peat in the arctic? Because in the past, the arctic was different today because of the earth's tilt being greater 11,000 years ago, therefore making the arctic warmer. It being warmer, it means it got more sun, that means plants were able to grow and do photosynthesis. But like any plant they eventually die, peat in the arctic is all those dead plants that died 11,000 years ago before the tilt was smaller, causing the arctic to get colder. The peat stayed and became trapped under snow and permafrost.

"Zombie fires can burn under the ice because there is a carbon sink and the peat is already dead in the cold keeping it from rotting. The zombie fires would burn during the spring or hot/warm weather but would only burn in the same place under the permafrost, having a decomposition of the peat. In the yeast lab, the foam that bubbled up represented the CO2 and had showed it could had worked because of the reaction. There was no light and the peat had not been exposed to oxygen, only under CO2, that made it easier to be able to burn during those certain times of the years. in the parsely lab it showed that the green BTB had changed colors due to where the light was, it could also mean that wherever the light was that it could have been easierfor the peat to burn and cause the temperature to change. cellular respiration that happened during the yeast lab could be that the glucose made a chemical reaction to the yeast, letting it activate what would happen and the co2. The plants photosynthesis woukld be the temperature or where the light is because the peat or dead plants. zombie fires can bburn under the permafrost  since there are dead sugar molecules and co2 trapped under the permafrost, letting it burn and decompose itself.","If the temperature on the Earth continues to rise, there could be a posibility of having more of a greater radiation tilt. In the parsely lab, the greenish colored BTB changed very little colors because of where the light placement was, meaning that ther was a good amount of oxgyen or no oxygen at all, making the BTB turn yellow if there was only CO2. The greater the amount of the angle of the tilt meant that there would be more direct light and making the temperature rise down.",,"To improve your response, try to organize your ideas more clearly and ensure each sentence logically follows the one before it.

"There is enough matter and energy in the system for a zombie fire to burn under ice because the energy combusts in the peat and is released with the CO2. Peat forms when dead plants start building up over hundreds or sometimes thousands of years in wetlands until it becomes a dirt-like substance. During the Tilt investigation, the jar with the most photosynthesis (release of O2), had the most light because the BTB turned blue, meaning less CO2 was present. The jar with the least amount of light had the smallest amount of photosynthesis because the BTB was yellow, meaning a larger amount of CO2 was present, which relates to the system because, in the past, the arctic was different than today because the tilt of the Earth was larger and could provide more solar radiation to the arctic. The tilt eventually became smaller, which provided less light to the Arctic, which lowered the temperature, so the wetlands made a thick layer of ice called permafrost over the peat. When fires burn, it melts permafrost and burns the peat. The permafrost freezes over the peat again, trapping the burning peat inside. Zombie fires can burn under the permafrost because when the permafrost formed, the matter and energy inside the peat gets trapped inside. During the yeast lab, the hot jar reacted the most to the yeast with a whopping 5.5 millimeters of foam during the cellular resperation. During the cellular resperation, sugar and oxygen are turned into CO2, H2O, and energy. When temperatures are lower, it slows that down the cellular resperation. When the fire is in the peat, it increaces the temperature of the peat, causing more cellular resperation. This means the fire can burn for longer under the permafrost because of the large amounts of matter and energy in the peat. The fire uses energy to continue to burn under the permafrost until spring, when the permafrost melts. This releases the energy with the CO2. That is why there is enough matter and energy in the system for a zombie fire to burn under ice.","If the temperature on Earth contiues to rise, more CO2 will be released into the atmosphere. The fire trapped under the permafrost continues to burn. When fire burns, it releases CO2, and that also gets trapped under the permafrost. Right now, it is trapped under the permafrost because it is cold. But if temperatures rise, the permafrost will melt, and the trapped CO2 will be released into the atmosphere.

"There was enough matter and energy in the system for a zombi fire to brun under ice because when we did the zombie fire model it show that in the past it was warm so there a lot of and because peat is  made of dead plant over hundreds and thousands of years in water and water doesn't have lots of oxxygen so it want decompose and dead plants are made of O2+C6H12O6. Plants have photosynthesis and the photosynthesis chemical equation is Cardon dioxide is matter, is wate is matter, light energy is energy, and that all turn to O2+C6H12O6 is energy/mater. When time past it start to it gets stored in the peat cause plants die the matter and energy gets stored in peat over the years and when zombie fires stated to increace which mean more decompastion which is a process by energy and matter re retured back to the atomosphere. Another way to show to it was in the Yeast/ Decomposition Lad because we learned after 10 mins in warm temperature the carbon dioxide was  up to 2.5cm tall well in cold tempertature after 10 mins it was 0.5cm tall. This tells you more sugar was converted to cardon dioxide at higher emperature.",If the temperature on earth continues to rise there willl be more fires because in the tilt model it shows the permafrost is going to melt for the heat so peat  will be exposed to oxygen and it's going to make large fires and more carbon dioxide relesed.,,"To enhance your response, consider organizing your ideas more clearly by separating different concepts into distinct sentences or paragraphs.

The reason there is enough matter and energy is because of the way peat is formed.Peat is formed by dead veggitation that forms under water for thousands of years and during this formation its little oxygen that is why peat doesnt decompose and the permafrost plays a role in it because the cold tempature slows down the decomposition. so this means there isnt enough energy flowing that causes the fire to last for a while. I know this because in the yeast lab there were oxygen that was in the yeast and this cause the yeast to have energy for a whiile and the yeast is just like the peat because there is little  oxygen there is to still have the fire burning under ground. this supports my claim because it demonstrates the decompostiton and it helps understand why there is energy and enough matter in the stystem for a zombie fire to burn under ice,If the temperature on Earth continues to rise there will be more carbon relased into the earths atompshpeher. i says this because in the tilt model for model A it was right under the light energy/sun and it stayed blue this is because it produced oxygen but test tube c on the other hand which had not light it produced the most carbon and it this represents the peat that is under ground and if there is more carbon this means the fires are going to be wilder and longer than ever on surface,,"To improve your response, consider organizing your explanation more clearly and sequentially.

"The zombie fires burn under ice because of the Earths tilt. 11,000 years ago the earth had a tilt of 24 degrees which was enough to sun light to heat the artic areas and photoshynthesize plants. The Earths tilt changed from 24 to 22.4 degrees 11,000 years later and causing the artic plants to die and become and very compact called peat. Peat is when dead plants combine together, theirs little to no oxygen in peat and can burn for a very long period of time I know this because we used a demo to see what would burn longer the demo was called burning fuels. Peat releases C02 (carbon dioxide) which is a gas that will cause things to help build a fire. When peat gets more air more fire will happen and more smoke as well. It also thaws out the permafrost that its being covered by.

Consider discussing how the energy from the sun originally helped these plants grow and how decomposition, or the lack thereof, plays a role in storing energy in peat. Additionally, including more detailed connections to scientific ideas like the carbon cycle or decomposition would strengthen your argument. For instance, you could elaborate on how peat's ability to release CO2 when burned links to the broader carbon cycle. Organizing your ideas into separate paragraphs for each key point can also help improve the clarity and flow of your writing.","You've done an excellent job explaining how the Earth's tilt has historically contributed to the formation of peat in the Arctic. Your mention of how the Earth's tilt changed from 24 to 22.4 degrees effectively sets the stage for understanding the conditions that led to the creation of peat. Additionally, your description of peat as compacted dead plants with little to no oxygen is accurate and helps explain why it can burn for a long time. The connection you made with the 'burning fuels' demonstration is a great use of specific evidence from class activities to support your explanation."
"The Zombie fires burned under the ice all winter because of the cold temperatures. When we did the yeast lab in class, there were three beakers. One with cold water, one with room temperature water and one with warm water. The cold beaker represented the temeratures in the Arctic (cold climate) and the bubbles created by the yeast represented decomposition.   The bubbles made by the yeast were made of Carbon Dioxide, the gas released when things decompose. According to the graph of the data we collected from the yeast lab, the cold beaker made the least bubbles and the warm beaker made the most bubbles. The cold beaker didn't make any bubbles the entire time, meaning no Carbon Dioxide was released. The warm beaker made 15 cm of bubbles after the 20 minutes, which means that the most Carbon Dioxide was released. This proves that colder temperatures decrease the rate of peat decomposition because the conditions are not good for the microorganisms to decompose the peat. Another reason that the peat is able to stay burning under the ice is it is stored with energy and glucose that was in the peat many years ago when there was more photosynthesis in the Arctic. When we did the tilt lab in class, we had a beaker in direct light and a beaker in indirect light. Each beaker had a leaf of parsley and was filled with BTB. The beaker under direct light represented the Earth 11,000 years ago, when the Earth's tilt was greater and there was more direct sunlight in the Arctic. The beaker in the indirect light represented the Earth today, which has a smaller tilt from the Sun and had less direct solar radiation in the Arctic. The BTB was used to track the amount of photosynthesis the plants produced. BTB turns blue when oxygen is present, which is the chemical released when plants do phoyosynthesis. After 24 hours, we came back to see what color the BTB had. The beaker under direct light became blue and had the most color change, meaning it did the most photosynthesis. The beaker in indirect light changed to a bluish-green color, meaning it did some photosynthesis. This means that the plants in the peat that formed thousands of years ago have lots of energy because they were able to do the most photosynthesis because they had more solar radiation and sunlight, and that is why they are able to stay burning all year long.","If temperatures on the Earth continue to rise, zombie fires will burn bigger and will burn all year long. According to the model we made in class, if the permasfrost is exposed to warm temperatures, it will melt, causing the fire to burn above ground and be exposed to oxygen which will fuel the fire even more. This also means there will be more Carbon Dioxide emissions into the atmosphere because according to the same model, smoke is made of Carbon Dioxide. If these fires are burning all year long due to rising temperatures, it can be costly to our environment and our communities.",,"To enhance your explanation further, ensure that you explicitly connect your claims back to the key concepts of energy and matter transformation. For example, when discussing the energy stored in peat, you could clarify how the transformation of solar energy into chemical energy through photosynthesis is crucial to understanding the sustained burning of peat. Additionally, while you have provided specific examples from class activities, it would strengthen your explanation to explicitly state how these activities relate to the broader scientific ideas mentioned in the task criteria, such as the carbon cycle and decomposition. This will help make your explanation more comprehensive and connected to multiple disciplinary ideas.","You have done a great job of incorporating evidence from the class activities into your explanation about zombie fires. For example, you used the yeast lab to illustrate how cold temperatures in the Arctic slow down decomposition by showing that the cold beaker made no bubbles, meaning no carbon dioxide was released. This clearly ties the lab findings to the real-world scenario of zombie fires. Additionally, your reference to the tilt lab effectively supports your explanation of why peat has stored energy; by explaining that the beaker under direct light represented historical conditions with more photosynthesis, you draw a strong connection between increased solar radiation in the past and the burning peat today."
"Zombie fires can burn under ice beccause it is trapped under the permafrost. In fall the fire burns above ground, destroying trees and other surrounding objects. Than in winter the fire moves under ground, beneath the permafrost. It can burn underground becuase of peat. Peat is made of dead vegetation that has been forming for thousands of years. When the peat is burning, it can burn for weeks. So that is how the fire burns throughtout winter. Than in spring, the permafrost melts and the fire comes back up. When the fire burns, it releases smoke which contains carbon dioxide. In class we did a lab with 3 beakers. In each beaker there was yeast to act as the deocmposer, sugar, and water. In the warrm beaker, it started at 0mm of foam and ended at 15mm. The foam represents the amount of carbon dioxide being released. In the room temperature beaker, it started at 0mm and ended at 13mm. Than in the cold beaker, it started at 0mm and ended at 0mm. This shows how the warmer it gets the more carbon dioxide is being released when a fire is burning but when the temperature gets colder, there isn't any carbon dioxide being released. In the past, the arctic was different than today because the tilt was greater. When the tilt is a greater angle, that means that there is more solar radiation coming from the sun. 11,000 years ago the tilt angle was 24.5* which means that there was more solar radiation. The more solar radiation means there will be more photosynthesis. But now the tilt is 22.1* which means there is less solar radiation and photosynthesis. We did a lab where we put 3 test tubes in different amount of lights. In each test tube there was BTB and a piece of parsley. The BTB showed us how much carbon idoxide was being released by changing colors. The BTB started as yellow. One test tube was directly under the light, one was behind the light, and one was covered in foil away from the light. The light demonstrated the sun. After waiting overnight, the test tube directly under the light changed from yellow to blue. That means a high amount of oxygen was produced so there was a high amount of photosynthesis becuase it had the most light. The test tube behind the light changed from yellow to a blueish/green color. That means there was a medium amount of oxygen producted so than there was a medium amount of photosynthesis. In the test tube covered in foil stayed yellow. That means that there was low amount of oxygen and low amount of photosynthesis. This lab tells us that the more sunlight a plant has, the more oxygen is produced. The more oxygen produced means that there will be more photosynthis. This relates to zombie fires because the more solar raditation there is, the more perfmafrost is going to start melting. When the permafrost starts melting, the peat will be exposed and the oxygen will fuel the fire. The more fire means that there will be more carbon dioxide being released.","If the temperature on Earth continues to rise perrmafrost will continue to melt. When the permafrost melts, that means the peat will be exposed to more oxygen. The oxygen will help fuel the fire underground. When the fire starts to burn, it will release more smoke which containes carbon dioxide. Once the fire burn all of the peat, there won't be any left becuase it takes peat around 11,000 years to form from dead vegetation that went through photosynthesis.",,"To enhance your response, consider organizing your ideas into clearer sections. For example, separate the discussion about how zombie fires can burn under ice from the explanation of the class lab results. This will make your argument more concise and easier to follow. Additionally, while you connected solar radiation and photosynthesis to zombie fires, make sure to clarify how these processes directly relate to the availability of matter and energy in the zombie fire system. Ensure that each part of your explanation ties back explicitly to your main claim about zombie fires, and consider summarizing your main points at the end to reinforce your conclusions.","Your response successfully explains how zombie fires can burn under ice by discussing the role of peat and the conditions under which it burns.

"In the past, the artic was different then today because the Earths tilt was different. 11,000 years ago, the Earths tilt was at 24.5 degrees and today, its 22.1 degrees. This has a huge affect because the larger the tilt, the more sunlight the Artic was getting. The sunlight also played a huge role. Back when the tilt was greater and the Artic was getting more sunlight, it wasnt all icy and cold like it is today. It was actully more like Wisconson. This is because high climate tempuatures lead to more biodiversity in the area and the more sunlight leads to more photosynthisis. The plants need photosynthisis to make peat because since plants are made of sugar, when the plants go through photosynthisis, it lets Co2 (Carbon Dioxide) out. This happens in wet areas making the plants more compact and go underground. They stay there for years and years (11,000yrs) and turn hard into something we know as peat. Peat is made of a carbon based plant material made of long chains of sugars that has been under permefrost for many years and has not decomposed. Later, when the Earths tilt became smaller (today), the Artic didnt get as much sunlight and as we all know the sunlight is what makes plants able to grow in the area. So now that they cant do that, the place has become icy and cold. It created something called permafrost. Permafrost is this cold cold sheet like layer in the Artic. Peat lives under the permafrost. You would think that peat would decompose under the permafrost but you would be incorrect. Things need oxygen to decompose and under the permafrost, there isnt enough oxygen for peat to decompose. In the oxygen and decomposition packet, we learned that the more oxygen in the area, the more the plant matter % goes down, otherwise known as how much decomposition happened. Its the same for no oxygen. This is also caused because when its colder, there is less oxygen. If there is little or no oxygen present in the area, things will not decompose. This leads to the peat not decomposing and burning under the permafrost all winter long and then being able to come back up. Also, when the peat burns, it melts the permafrost and creates gaps for oxygen to get let in whilst it is burning. Oxygen feeds the fire and lets it grow bigger but when winter time comes, the permafrost closes up letting no oxygen in for peat to decompose and this  How was there enough matter and energy in the system for a zombie fire to burn under ice and this is how there is enough matter and energy in the system for a zombie fire to burn under ice.","If the tempuatures on Earth continue to rise, I think that the fires will get worse. As we saw in class during the tilt investigation, the warmer the area is, the more biodiversity that is present. This would most likely get rid of the icy Artic and replace it with an enviorment more closer to one we live in today. This would give the fires more things to burn and be better exposed to oxygen and since oxygen helps fires burn, the fires would continue to get worse.",,"To further enhance your explanation, consider organizing your response into clear sections with specific focus. Start with a claim about how zombie fires can burn under ice, then discuss the formation and preservation of peat, and finally, explain how these contribute to zombie fires. More explicitly connect your evidence to the claim by clearly indicating how each piece of evidence supports your argument. For example, after explaining the Earth's tilt and its impact on climate, directly relate it to peat formation and preservation. Additionally, when discussing the role of oxygen in decomposition, reinforce the idea of how this affects the burning of peat. This structure will help make your argument more concise and easier to follow.","You've done a great job incorporating scientific concepts like Earth's tilt, photosynthesis, and decomposition into your explanation. For instance, you wrote, ""In the past, the arctic was different then today because the Earths tilt was different. 11,000 years ago, the Earths tilt was at 24.5 degrees and today, its 22.1 degrees.""

"Peat is formed by mostly dead plants made of sugar under ground from 11,000 years ago, the permaforst fire + more temp are polluting the permaforst peat then gets exposed to oxygen and the co2 is realeased when peat is burned. When the aritc cools there are less dicrect sunlight and less solar energy, this means that peat and the permaforst information follows by this, And the tilt is greater which means it = more solar energry to the artic.
Photosynthesis occurs in plants where they connect carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen using sunlight, This process not only produces food for the plants but also releases oxyggen into the atmosphere , which is and essential for sunlight and other organisms. As we saw in our lab with the btb changing we saw that we used 3 different test tubes and put one in a lot of light the other in less and the other one with no light the one with the more light had a highher amount of co2 and it produced psn the second one had a medium amount of co2 and also had a medium amount of psn the last one had very low co2 and a low psn.

"Zombie fires can burn under ice because in April-June because its the summer weather. Summer weather are very warm/hot and since the tempurate increase, then that means the zombie fires tempurate increased as well. This can increase their enegry to release more Co2 in the air. Also in September it didn't burn that much because thats in the cold tempurate and meaning that the fire didn't have enough energy to realease into the air. This can be the same thing with peat not decomposing because of the different tempurate. I can relate thses two into lab we did in class. We used yeast, gulcose (Sugar) and 3 types of tempurate water. One was cold, another was room tempurate and lastly the warm water. we put in the yeast and glucose into the 3 glass and figure out which glass created more bubbles/CO2. We stir them so the yeast can eat the sugar and timed those 3 for 20 mins to see how tall the bubbles will form. For the 1st, (cold) this one didn't react that much meaning the height of the bubbles were at 0. This shows colder tempurate didn't give enough energy to the yeast and the yeast didn't decompose nor release any Co2. Onto the next one, the room tempuarte one was giving more reaction than the first one because this was a little warmer. In the first 2-4 the yeast didn't react but warming up. But in the 6-20min mark it started to increase it's lenght going to 2mm-13mm, and as its final height of 13mm, this can mean that there was energy for the yeast to decompose and release Co2 and form more bubbles. Lastly the warm beaker, for the first 2min the bubbles didn't form but in the 4-20 mark the bubbles grew out a lot and the yeast had so much energy to decompose and release more Co2. This grew out to 1mm-15mm. This can relate to zombie fire and peat decomposing because peat is under the permafrost and can't decompose because it's too cold. But fire is still bruning but not as much because it was in the colder weather. But when it's the warmer weather the fire has enough energy to release Co2 and making peat decompose easier. ","If the temperature Earth's continues to rise, then the zombie fires can release more Co2 and take more energy and peat will decompose faster as well becasue the increase of global warming.

"Zombie fires can burn under ice because of the high amounts of peat, and the solar radiation the arctic used to get 11,000 years ago. 11,000 years ago, the arctic was much hotter. The earths tilt was larger, at 24.5 degrees. This allowed more direct sunlight and solar radiation to the arctic. All this sun allowed plants to grow and more photosynsthisis to happen. These plants decomposed over time, and eventuallly turned to peat underground. Now the earths tilt is 22.1 degrees which causes less solar radiation for the arctic. But because of the plants that grew in the past, there is so much peat underground. In the burning fuels lab, we learned that peat can burn for the longest amount of time at 6 hours. With so much peat underground in the zombie fire system, it allows fires to burn for a very long time. The peat underground also does not decompose. All this peat formed underwater where there was no oxygen. according to the oxygen and decomposition worksheet, when no additional oxygen is added to plant matter, it barely decomposes. This experiment put plant matter with no additional oxygen, low additional oxygen. medium additional oxygen, and high additional oxygen for 100 days. The beaker with no additional oxygen had the lowest decomposing rate as there was still 60% of the plant matter still left after the 100 days. The Beaker with high additional oxygen decomposed the most, after 100 days there was only around 10% of the plant matter still left. Connecting this back to the peat, since the peat formed under the water with no additional oxygen, it's decomposition rate is very low, and won't decompose for thousands of years. because of the earth's tilt 11,000 years ago, there was more direct sunlight which allowed photosynthisis. In our tilt lab we found out that plants produce more sugan and oxygen from direct light. There was a plant in each tube, one had direct sunlight, one had indirect sunlight, and one had no sunlight. The BTB in the direct sunlight tube changed the most becasuse the most photosynthisis happened. Since there was more direct sun 11,000 years ago, there were many plants in the arctic. Now they have all turned to peat, which allows a zombie fire to burn under ice.","If the temperature on Earth continues to rise, the amount of zombie fires would go down over time. As tempuratures the rise, the permafrost which covers the peat could melt. When the permafrost melts, peat is exposed to oxygen. When peat is exposed to oxygen, it decomposes. According to the Oxygen and Decomposition worksheet mentioned earlier, the more oxygen peat is exposed to, the more it decomposes. over time as decomposition happens, the zombie fire system will die down as there is less peat to burn, which results in less fires and shorter burning fires. Less carbon dioxide would come from zombie fires because they will happen less often, and for a shorter amount of time.

Additionally, you referenced the 'tilt lab' and 'BTB lab,' showing that you are connecting class experiments to your explanation of energy and matter in the system."
"Zombie fires can burn under ice because of how peat is formed. Peat is formed by plants dying and being packed down underwater. In the tilt investigation lab, we learned that plants go through more photosynthesis when they have more light. We know this because the BTB in the plant under direct light was blue, while the BTB in the plant under no light was a yellowish green. BTB only changes color when it is exposed to Oxygen or Carbon Dioxide. When there is more oxygen present, the BTB is bluer in color and when there is more carbon present, the BTB is a yellowis green. The other thing we learned in that lab is how tilt affects  solar radiation in the Arctic. More tilt means there is more solar radiation or sunlight, in the Arctic. More solar radiation in the Arctic means there is more photosynthesis, which we learned from the lab. This shows that zombie fires can burn under ice because 11,000 years ago Earth had a 24.5 degree tilt, where as today Earth has a 22.1 degree tilt. This connects back to our lab where we learned that more tilt means more sunlight in the Arctic. 11,000 years ago there was more sunlight in the Arctic, which means there was a lot more photosynthesis. Plants were able to grow in the Arctic and as they took in carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight, the plants made sugar and oxygen. The plants then died, and because the Arctic was getting colder, the plants were able to store all of this sugar and oxygen without decomposing. The plants then piled on to each other underwater over 11,000 years and formed peat. Peat is made of these dead plants that have not decomposed, so the peat still holds the energy from the sugar and the matter from the sugar and oxygen. This means the peat has enough energy and matter to keep burning underground. To further expand on the decomposition to know there was enough matter and energy in the system for a zombie fire to burn is that the cold temperatures kept the matter and energy stored in the peat. In the yeast lab we did in class we saw that throughout 20 minutes, the cold beaker had a high of 0mm of bubbles, where as the warm beaker had a high of 15mm of bubbles. This shows how there was enough matter and enery in the system for zombie fires to burn because things don't decompose in the cold. The sugar in our yeast lab acted as our decomposer (peat) and the yeast was our decomposers in the peat. The sugar broke down the yeast and caused the yeast to make bubbles. The bubbles were made of carbon dioxide and represented the fire in a zombie fire system. This all connects back to the zombie fire system because each of the components of our lab represented a part of the zombie fire system. The peat in a zombie fire system, made of dead plant matter, is not decomposing in the zombie fire system. Instead it is storing all of its energy to make the fire in the system. The peat can not decompose in cold temperatures, like the yeast. The peat is locked in permafrost which keeps the peat cold and prevents it from decomposing. The peat then releases this energy when it makes fire, as the energy is made in to carbon dioxide in smoke. This is just like how the yeast and sugar made bubbles out of carbon dioxide by releasing their energy in to the air.","If the temperature on Earth continues to rise, then more energy and carbon dioxide will be released in to the zombie fire system. One way I know that energy and carbon dioxide will be released is when I look at the yeast lab we did in class. When the yeast and sugar were put in to a cold beaker, the system created 0 mm of bubbles. When the yeast and suger were put in to a warm beaker, the system produced 15 mm of bubbles. This shows that more carbon dioxide and energy will be released in to the zombie fire system because the beakers represented the zombie fire system. The cold beaker had no bubbles in it because no decomposition happened in the system. This is because things don't decompose in cold temperatures. The peat is currently locked in the permafrost in the Arctic. If the permafrost melts because of the rising temperatures, the peat will be able to decompose. When the peat decomposes, it releases carbon dioxide and energy from all of the sugar and oxygen it is made of. The dead plants the peat is made of will release all of their energy, due to being able to decompose. Another way I know carbon dioide and energy will be released is the graph in the oxygen and decomposition worksheet. The graph shows that when high additional oxygen was added to plant matter it went from 80% to 10%, where as when low additional oxygen was added to plant matter it went from 80% to 30%. This is showing that the more oxygen that is there, more decomposition happens. In the permafrost, the peat does not get very much or any oxygen at all. This means it can not decompose and therfore stores its sugar and oxygen. When the permafrost melts due to rising temperatures, the peat would be exposed to much more oxygen. This means the peat would be able to decompose due to more oxygen and the peat would release all of its energy and matter back out in to the zombie fire system.",,"To enhance the clarity and coherence of your response, consider organizing your ideas more clearly. Start by grouping similar ideas together, such as all points about peat formation followed by points about decomposition. This will help your reader follow your argument more easily. For instance, after discussing peat formation, you could transition into how cold temperatures affect decomposition more clearly before moving into the details of the yeast lab.

Additionally, your explanation of the yeast lab, where ""the cold beaker had a high of 0mm of bubbles, whereas the warm beaker had a high of 15mm of bubbles,"" effectively illustrates how decomposition is affected by temperature, tying it back to the zombie fire system. This demonstrates a strong use of empirical evidence from class activities to support your claim."
"Zombie fires can burn under ice because there is a lot of peat under the permafrost. Before the fire burns, the energy is in the peat. Peat is made of dead plants that are made of sugar. The energy from the fire is slowely burning the permafrost, making the fire more exposed to O2. This is making more CO2 being released because the more O2 means the more CO2 released. In the tilt lab, the test tube under direct light started off yellowish-green. After a day of being under the light, the BTB turned blue. While as the one that got no light stated off yellowish-green and the color didnt change. This shows that the higher amount of oxygen made under the light, the more photosynthesis happens. This related back to zombie fires because the more O2 means the more the fire will burn and the more gasses it will release. Another example is the yeast/decompostition lab. The cold beaker over the 20 minutes did not have a single cm of foam. While the warm beaker over the 20 mintes got 15cm of foam. The foam was CO2 showing that the more energy there is, the more decomposition there will be. I know this because yeast reacts in warm water better than room temp. or cold. Back to the tilt lab; the more tilt there is means the more solar radiation the artic will get. This will cause more photosynthesis because as we saw in the tilt lab, the more light exposed, means the more photosynthesis that will happen. As of right now, the earths tilt is less than it was 11,000 years ago; this is why not much photsynthesis is happening in the arctic and the zombie fires are burning for longer."," If the tempatures keep rising, the zombie fires will get bigger. If the tempatures on earth continue to rise the zombie fires will be exposed to more O2. The more O2 the fires are exposed to means the more energy being released from the fire. This will make thee peat burn more and the fires will release more CO2. Evidence I have to support my prediction is from the yeast lab. In the colder tempature water, there was no decompostion. While the warm water had 15 cm of foam. This shows that the fires will keep getting bigger becuase the hotter it is, the more decompostion that is happening.",,"To improve your response, consider explicitly connecting the evidence from your class activities to the broader concepts of the carbon cycle and decomposition, as mentioned in the assignment criteria.

Additionally, structuring your response with clear transitions between different points could help improve organization. Starting with a clear explanation of how peat forms and why it doesn't decompose quickly could provide a stronger foundation for your argument.

This directly addresses the task of discussing matter and energy in the zombie fire system. Additionally, you have effectively used evidence from class activities, such as the tilt lab and the yeast/decomposition lab, to support your points. For example, you mentioned how ""the test tube under direct light started off yellowish-green"" in the tilt lab, providing a clear link to the scientific process of photosynthesis."
"There is enough matter and energy in the system for a zombie fire to burn under the ice because of peat. Zombie fires are able to burn under the ice because of peat being able to fuel the fire. Peat is formed up of dead plants that never fully decomposed. This peat is the main fuel source for this fire. When the peat burns its realasing Co2 into the air and energy into the air opeing gaps in the permafrost. Why the peat is able to burn so long because, of earths tilt. 11,000 years ago the earths tilt was around 24.5 degress but now its at 22.1. This tilt in the earth causes more direct sunlight to the earth causing the temputures to be higher, and more solar radiation. Solar radiation is a very big factor in why these fires burn so long. When we preformed the tilt lab, we were given three bottles of btb with plants in them and placed them under diffrent amounts of light: Direct light, Indirect light, and No light. When the plant had low light it produced low amounts of oxygen and low photoysynthesis, when the inderect light was shows it had some of oxygen and some photosythnsis, and when the direct light was revealed it had the most amount of oxygen and most photosyhnthesis. Another way that photosynthesis is increasing isbecause of the Co2. In our yeast experiment we were given 3 beakers, the beakers are: Cold Beaker, Room tmeputare beaker and a warm beaker, the cold beaker did not increase in the fam, the room temp beaker did increase slightly but the warm beaker increased signifigtly. This is showing that the increase in Co2 is allowing photosynthesis to happen as well. So this proves now that since there is more Co2 and more Sunlight from the earths tilt there is more Photosynthesis.  Photosynthesis relates back to peat because at one point peat was a living plant doing photosynthesi, so when there is an increase in photosynthesis this causes and increase in peat. With these higer temputres from the tilt in the earth and the fire the permafrost melts.  When the permafrost melts it allows for oxygen to enter the fire fueling the fire more. So with the increase in peat theres and increase in the fuel source for the fire and when the fire burns it allows oxygen to get in and fuel the fire. Thiis fire then allows for more decompositon of the permafrost aka the permafrost melting. So there is enough matter and energy to brun under the ice because of peat. ",If temputres begin to rise more there will be more photosynthesis and the permafrost will melt at a much fater rate. This can be proven because right now the permafrost is melting quickly because the earths tilt caused more direct sunlight for plants. These plants are enuntually made into peat which then fuels the fire realsing Co2 into the air allowing for even more plants to go through the process of photsynthesis and all leading back into peat. With an increase in the sunlight and warmer temputres the peat will be able to produce more Co2 which would cuase more photosynthesis leading to an increase in fuel and a increase in how fast the permafrost melts.,,"To improve your response, consider organizing your ideas more clearly to enhance readability. For instance, separate the formation of peat, its inability to decompose, and its role in zombie fires into distinct sections. This will make your explanation easier to follow. Additionally, when discussing class activities, such as the yeast experiment and the tilt lab, try to link them more explicitly to your main claim about zombie fires. For example, you could clarify how the results from the yeast experiment demonstrate the relationship between CO2 levels and photosynthesis, and how this relates back to peat formation.

"Zombie fires can burn under ice because of the left over peat in the permafrost.
According to our tilt investigation models, 11,000 years ago the earth had a tilt of 24.5º causing the arctic to get more direct light and that made the arctic warmer. Because there was more light plants were able to go through photosynthesis and go through cellular respiration. This makes the chemical energy (sugar, CO2, and H2O) into usable energy (C6 H12 O6 and O2). Now the earth has a a tilt of 22.1º and the the arctic is frozen. Accoriding to the yeast lab, the cold beaker had no reaction after 20 mintes, the room temperature beaker had 13cm of bubbles and the warm beaker had 15 cm of bubbles after 20 minutes. This lab hag sugar and oxygen put into it, and the were changed into carbon dioxide, water, and energy, but it decomposed (acceot for the cold beaker!). That is the same reaction that burning peat has because peat is dead plants that went through PSN.
They are ready burn because they have oxygen and chemical energy in them. The yeast lab showed us that when its too cold plants can't decompose and now that the tilt is giving the arctic indirect light it's very cold. This caused the peat to stay cold and not deocompse in the ice. But when there are fires, this causes the permafrost to thaw and all the peat with all that stored energy can burn. Thats why there is enough matter and energy in the arctic for zombie fires to burn under ice.","If the temperature on earth continues to rise, the peat will continue to burn for a while but eventually stop.
According to what we learned about tilt, the earth's tilt used to be 24.5º and the arctic was warm and able to grow plants, now they tilt is 22.1º and the arctic is cold and peat is frozen in the permafrost. The yeast lab that demonstrates decomosition showed that the cole beaker had of cm of bubbles and decomposition, but the warm beaker had 15cm of bubbles and decomposition. Now global warming is allowing peat to thaw out and burn.
I predict that if the temperature continues to rise the peat will continue to burn. But if the temperature keeps rising it will allow the peat to decompose and this zombie fires will stop becuase the peat is gone. Eventually plants will start growing back and going through PSN.",,"To improve your response, consider organizing your explanation more clearly by breaking it into distinct sections or paragraphs. For instance, you could first explain how peat is formed, then discuss why it hasn't decomposed, and finally, connect these ideas to zombie fires. Additionally, ensure that your explanation of the yeast lab is directly tied to the zombie fire system by clarifying how the lack of decomposition in cold conditions contributes to the availability of matter and energy for zombie fires. This will help deepen the connection between your evidence and your claims, and strengthen the overall coherence of your explanation.","Your response does an excellent job of integrating evidence from class activities, such as the tilt investigation models and the yeast lab, to explain the presence of peat in the Arctic and its role in zombie fires.

"The zombie fires can burn under the ice because of the earths tilt in the aritc along time ago.11,000 years ago the tilt of the earth was not the same as it is today, currently the tilt of the earth is about 23.5 but, 11,000 years ago the tilt of the earth was 24.5 degrees and this affected the amount of solar radiation that the artic could be exposed too. in a lab that we did in class we positioned three test tubes in diffrent perspectives and distances from a light all of the test tubes had a little sample of parsely and BTB solution with was naturally a greenish yellow, one test tube was directly underneath the light, one test tube was by the light, but not direvtly under it, and the final test tube was secluded from the rest and was in bacically the dark. we were looking for a change in color from the test tubes, all of the test tubes started at a greenish yellow color but after a while when we checked the test tubes we founf that the tube under direct sunlight was the most affected and the most changed because the test tube had become completley blue, while the test tube that was not under a light didnt change at all. this shows that when the artic was under more direct light from the sun 11,000 years ago that the plants where doing more phtosynthesis, wich is why the peat in the artice contains so much enrgy and fuel for the zombie fires to use to brun through the winter. ","My prediction is that in the future due to global warming, the permifrost over the peat is going to melt exposing the peat to more oxygen, causing it to decompose faster, releasing a lot of carbon dioxide in the air. we know that with higher oxygen concentration  the more decomposition because on the oxygen and decomposition document figure 2, the graph shows four lines each with diffrent oxygen concentrations. the highest oxygen concentration decomposed the plant matter from 75% to 25% in 50 days unlike the rest of the oxygen concentrations wich decomposed the plant mater percent from 75 to 25 in more like 75 or more days. This proves that a higher amount of oxygen the more decomposition will occur, wich  means that in the future with global warming melting away the permisfrost covering the peat, will expose it to more oxygen and will therefore cause it to decompose faster and relaese a lot of carbon dioxide into the air.",,"To improve your response, consider organizing your ideas more clearly by using the sentence starters provided. For example, start with 'Zombie fires can burn under ice because...' to directly address the question. Additionally, ensure that your explanation connects the formation of peat and its preservation over time to the presence of zombie fires. You could elaborate on why peat hasn't decomposed by mentioning the cold, anaerobic conditions in the Arctic, which prevent decomposition. Finally, consider breaking down your response into smaller paragraphs for better readability, and ensure your spelling and grammar are checked for clarity.","You've done a great job in explaining the historical context of the Earth's tilt and its impact on solar radiation in the Arctic. Your reference to the class lab activity involving test tubes and BTB solution is a strong piece of evidence. By describing how the test tube under direct light changed color, you've effectively illustrated the impact of sunlight on photosynthesis, which ties back to the formation of peat. Your explanation of the historical tilt of the Earth at 24.5 degrees 11,000 years ago compared to today's 23.5 degrees adds depth to your answer."
"There is enough matter and energy in the system for zombie fire to burn under ice. According to the tilt lab the tube that was directly under the light created the most oxygen, we knows this because the BTB changed from yellow-ish green to blue. However the tube that got no light created no oxygen, we knew this because the color of the BTB stayed yellow-ish green. 11,000 years ago  when the plants that formed peat were alive the earths tilt was 24.5 degrees, this meant that the plants in the arctic got more solar radiation(sunlight), more solar radiation means more psn, and more psn means more sugar in peat. According to the oxygen and decomposition sheet in figure 2 the bottle with high oxygen started with 80% of plant matter and ended with ~10% plant matter. This tells us that the amount of oxygen plant matter gets affects how much it decomposes. Peat forms underwater but water doesn't have lots of oxygen this causes peat to form without lots of oxygen inside it making it harder to decompose, this is why there is so much matter(peat) it can't decompose but there is another reason. According to the yeast lab the cold beaker didn't make any bubble(bubbles represent c02) during all of the 20 minutes, but the warm beaker made bubbles up to 15 cm inside the beaker. This means that it is easier for the peat to burn or decompose when it is warmer, the problem is peat is stored under permafrost. The permafrost makes the peat stay cold and not decompose or burn, this is why there is so much plant matter it was essentially frozen in place.","If the temperatures continue to rise, I think that in the future zombie fires will grow larger but eventually depending on how warm it is the permafrost could start melting from global warming and all the peat will be exposed and burn even more than now. I think this beacuse the zombie fires have already been burning for years and they havn't change their pattern of going underground and coming back up, this means that we can assume they will continue to do the same thing. The problem is if global warming heats up the permafrost so much that it starts to melt it could start exposing more peat. You also have to take into account the fact that the peat is also burning/melting the permafrost more and more each year. According to our burning lab the peat burned for 6 hours and only lost ~0.1g. This shows you that the peat can burn for a while and barley lose any mass. The global warming and the peat together could become so much that all the permafrost melts. Once all the permafrost melts all the peat will be open to burn, it will no longer be ""protected"" by the permafrost anymore.",,"To enhance your response further, consider organizing your ideas more clearly by following the suggested sentence starters.

Lastly, ensure that your writing is concise by avoiding repetition, which will make your arguments clearer and more persuasive.","Your response does a great job of incorporating evidence from multiple class activities to support your explanation of how zombie fires can burn under ice. For example, you effectively used evidence from the tilt lab to explain how the plants in the Arctic received more solar radiation due to Earth's tilt, leading to more photosynthesis and hence more sugar in peat. This demonstrates a clear understanding of how energy was stored in the system. You also connected your findings from the oxygen and decomposition sheet well by explaining how peat forms without much oxygen, hence it decomposes slowly, contributing to the availability of matter for fires."
"There was enough matter and energy  in the system for the zombie fires to burn under ice  because 11,000 years ago earths tilt was greater than it is today causing more sunlight to hit the artic which makes more photosynthesis happen. We know this because in the tilt lab the test tube under direct sunlight created the most oxygen because the BTB changed the most color turning bright blue , compared to the test tube that got no sunlight which stayed yellow. Meaning the test tube under light created the most oxygen and the one with no sunlight created no oxygen so it went through no photosynthesis. So this relates because in the artic if the plants there can go through more photosynthesis than there will be more plants therfore having enough matter and energy for the fires to burn. The zombie fire system takes in oxygen to fuel the fire and  from the fire burning it releses carbon dioxide.   Peat is formed by plants made of sugar that have been under permafrost for many years that come together to make peat that has not decomposed. Peat hasnt decomposed because of the cold tempertures and because of the lack of oxygen. The plant matter experimnt shows you can see that the bottle that had a high amount of of oxygen at 100 days had 10% plant matter meaning a lot of oxygen was released and sugar was being broken down or decomposed. But the bottle with no oxygen at 100 days had 65% plant matter. showing that oxygen is important in decomposion and since there was not a lot in the water the peat had a harder time decomposing. This shows how there is enough energy for the zombie fires to burn because the peat wont decompose. ","If the temperatures continue to rise the permafrost could start to melt which would release more oxygen, more oxygen could cause more decomposition of the peat causing less matter for the fire to burn which would cause the fire to have less energy so it couldnt burn as long. I know this because in the oxygen and decomposition lab the bottle with a high amount of oxygen had only 10% of plant matter so 90% of it decomposed , but the bottle with no oxygen at 100 days had 65% plant matter so not as much of it decomposed. This shows that oxygen is importnat in decompostion and the more that you have of it the more likely things will decompose, so if the tempertures keep rising and the permafrost melts giving off more oxygen the peat will have more of a chance of decomposing. ",,"To enhance your response, consider structuring your explanation to clearly separate the flow of energy and the transformation of matter.

Then, provide a more organized sequence by first discussing the increased photosynthesis due to Earth's tilt, followed by how the preserved peat contributes to the fires. Also, ensure each piece of evidence directly supports the part of the claim you're discussing. For example, you could start with how increased sunlight led to more photosynthesis and thus more plant matter, then move to how the lack of decomposition due to cold and low oxygen preserves the peat. Finally, explicitly connect the scientific concepts like photosynthesis and decomposition to the zombie fire system, reinforcing the processes involved.","Your response effectively outlines how the tilt of the Earth contributed to increased photosynthesis in the Arctic, which is a great connection to the idea of energy and matter accumulation. You used specific evidence from the tilt lab by explaining how the test tube under direct sunlight created the most oxygen because the BTB changed color, showing a deep understanding of the experiment.

"
The peat stores enough energy for a zombie fire to burn under the ice. In the tilt investigation lab we did in class we learned that the greater of an angle the tilt has the more dirert sun light plants will get in the artic. When we put test tube A under direct sunlight the BTB color changed to blue which means it produced the most amount of O2 and it did the most PSN. We also figured out that test Tubes B and C didn't have lots of color change which means they produced less amounts of PSN and oxygen. This lab shows when there's more direct sun light the more sugar and O2 the plants will produce. 11,000 years ago the tilt of the earth was 24.5 degrees and today it is 22.1 degrees. This shows that the change of tilt has an effect on how fast the plants turn into peat so the peat can burn under the ice. This also shows that the flow of energy in zombie fires would've been faster 11,000 years ago then today. In the Yeast lab we used beakers with cold, room temperature and warm water to see if there was a difrence when sugar and yeast was mixed together. Eventually we saw bubbles in each beaker the cold beaker had 0cm of C02 /bubbles. The room temperature beaker got up to 13cm of C02 and the warm had bubbles right away and it got up to 15cm  of C02. This lab shows how the warmer the temperature the more C02 will be produced from the stored energy of the zombie fire. The graph from the O2 and decomposition sheet shows that high additional oxygen starts at about 80% plant matter and takes 100 days for decomposition time. This shows that the more O2 in water allows for dead plants to decompose and make more peat so zombie fires can burn. ","If the temperature on Earth contunues to rise the ice in the artic will melt the peat faster.In our model the dead plants that made sugar 11,000 years ago through PSN is the peat of the fire. The smoke is C02 being released. The peat is also exposed to more oxygen which fuels the zombie fire more. The yeast lab we did in class has the sugar as the peat, water as oxygen, yeast as our fuel source to make bubbles. This means that the warmer temperatures will make the peat burn out of the permafrost faster. This also means the peat will be exposed to more O2.",,"To enhance your explanation, consider organizing your response to more explicitly connect each piece of evidence to the claim about zombie fires.

Additionally, your reference to the Yeast lab helps to illustrate how temperature variations affect CO2 production, which is crucial in understanding the decomposition process and the formation of peat."
"There was enough matter and energy in the system for a zombie fire to burn under ice, because peats formed by dead plants (sugar) cumilated over 11,000 years. Since peat is dead plants the plants were once alive and went through the process of photosynthysis. When making our class model i learned for a zombie fire to burn under ice it must be exposed to oxygen. This means that permafrost is melting because of oxygen and warmer tempatures. I learned that less oxygen is equal to less decomposition so more oxygen stored would mean more decomposition. When peats exposed to oxygen the oxygen fuels fire and more fire will decompose the perma frost more and release carbon dioxide which affecfts the air quality. Increased energy from the sun caused matter and energy to be stored as sugar in the peat in the zombie fire system. I know this because during our tilt lab, the test tube under direct sunlight changed the most color. It changed to bright blue compared to the test tube with no light/not under sunlight stayed yellow. Meaning that the test tube that was under the light created the most oxygen and the one without created no oxygen which shows that it went through no photosynthysis. The test tube under the sunlight created the most oxygen and sugar because they are both the two outputs of photosynthysis. When we learned about tilt i learned that tilt is the angle between two axises   
the orbital acess and rotational access this relates to the artic by there not being much tilt in present time, in the past, the artic was different than today because there was much more solar radiation then now. As the tilt of the earth decreased, less solar radiation was availible in the Artic. The artic cooled and there was less solar energy and direct sunlight and this led to peat and permafrost formation. In past time (11,000) years ago, the tilt was measured 24.5 and present time is 22.1, Greater angle of tilt equals more direct solar radiation which leads to more photosynthysis.

Zombie fires cand burn under ice because Of the amount of peat found in the arctic.Since there is alot of peat found in the artic that gave the fire enough energey to maintain its energy to keep burning even though it was trapped in the ice and snow.The reason that there was enough peat to keep the fire burning is couse of the cold wet conditions in the artic that slowed  the decompisition down making it so when the fire started it was still there fueling the fire but when peat burns it realses cO2.another reason that there was more peat was cause of in the past when the earths tilt was in favor of the articic its solor energy was mostly focused on tha artic witch meant more photosyntheisis witch also meant more peat.and zombie fires feed on organic matter thats often found in peat and probaly the soil too and wants its spring or summer when the solor energy increase then the the fire will ignite and spread due too the supply of Oxegyn.,"iif the tempeture on  earth contionous to rise i think that the growth of fires will increase cause the solar power and that will increas the peat in the artic causing more zombie fires under the ice.

"In the past, the artic was diffrent than today because more solar energy reaches the artic which is also higher solar raditation and also means more photosynthesis which gives more plants that involve O2, CO2+H2O and it all comes togther which formed it all.",If the temputure on earth continues to rise there will be higher solar radiation which also means more photosynthesis and more oxygen. This also means Oxygen and higher solar will mean more energy which could cause peat ( which is dead plants) to burn which would cause zombie fires as well.,,"To strengthen your response, try to explicitly connect how these historical conditions relate to the formation and persistence of peat. You could say, ""Peat is formed by the accumulation of plant material in waterlogged conditions where high solar radiation and photosynthesis contribute to plant growth."" Additionally, discuss why peat doesn't decompose easily, such as the cold and wet conditions that slow down decomposition processes, allowing zombie fires to persist. Remember to use evidence from class activities, like the ""Yeast/Decomposition Lab,"" to support your claims about decomposition and energy flow.","You did a good job mentioning how the Arctic was different in the past by noting that ""more solar energy reaches the Arctic... which gives more plants."" This touches on the key point that increased solar radiation leads to more photosynthesis, which is important for understanding the historical context of plant growth and peat formation."
Zombie fires can burn under ice because the combination of trapped heat available fuel and sufficient oxygen allows zombie fires to burn under ice Peat is formbed by the accumulation of partially decayed organic matter in waterlogged conditions in the past the arctic was different from today because the earth was more tilt then from today and that mean it is diffecault for the sun to really reach the actic so that mean lest peat that also good because if the sun really reach the arctic then it will be a lot more water fluding states because of how much ice is in antarctica.,rising temperatures will contribute to the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers resulting in higher sea levels that can harm national habitats.,,"To improve your response, try to better organize your thoughts for clarity and completeness. For example, separate each idea into its own sentence or paragraph: start with how peat forms, why it doesn't decompose, and how this contributes to zombie fires. Also, be sure to include specific evidence from the class activities, such as the burning fuel samples demonstration or the decomposition lab, to support your claims. This will strengthen your explanation by connecting it to empirical evidence, as required by the task.

"increase energy from the sun caused matter and energy to be stored as sugar in the peat in the zombie fire system. Zombie fires can burn under ice because peat under the ice. 
Lesser tilt means less solar radiation which means lesser plants in the Arctic today.  In the tilt investigation.",If the temperature on Earth continues to rise the dead plants will burn because of the sun and it will start wild fires.,,"To enhance your explanation, it would be beneficial to expand on how peat is formed in the Arctic and why it remains undecomposed. You can strengthen your argument by incorporating evidence from the class activities, such as the Yeast/Decomposition Lab, to explain the decomposition process. Additionally, try to connect back to the carbon cycle and how it plays a role in the peat not decomposing. This will address the task criteria more comprehensively by making connections to multiple disciplinary ideas. Also, consider organizing your points to flow logically from one to the next, such as starting with peat formation, then discussing decomposition, and finally linking these to the zombie fires.","You've made a good start in explaining the connection between solar radiation and the formation of peat. Your sentence, ""increase energy from the sun caused matter and energy to be stored as sugar in the peat in the zombie fire system,"" effectively links solar energy to the storage of energy in peat, which is a solid point in explaining how energy is stored in the system."
"zombie fires are able to burn because the peat under the perma frost.  Antarctica use to grow plants and the dead plants created peat, not long after antarctica turned into a icy tundra.  The peat under the perma frost couldnt decompose due to the cool tempatures. Due to it not being able to decompose, the fire can burn for a very long period of time",I think the fires will countinue to burn for a coupke years longer.  Tho long after the peat will decompose due to the rising tempatures and it'll dry up.  Due to the ash and smoke going into the atmosphere And it'll get even hotter.,,"To strengthen your response, try to incorporate more specific evidence from the class activities, such as the 'Burning fuel samples demonstration' or the 'Yeast/Decomposition Lab.' These could provide concrete examples to support your explanation of how energy flows through the zombie fire system. Additionally, when discussing the energy flow, explicitly mention how energy enters and exits the system, which would address the assignment's criteria more thoroughly. Structuring your answer with clear headings or bullet points for each part of your explanation could also help organize your thoughts and make your writing more concise.","You have done a good job of identifying the role of peat in the persistence of zombie fires. Specifically, you mentioned that 'peat under the perma frost' is a key component, and you described how 'Antarctica use to grow plants and the dead plants created peat,' which is an accurate connection to the historical formation of peat. Additionally, you correctly noted that 'the peat under the perma frost couldnt decompose due to the cool tempatures,' which effectively explains the lack of decomposition and its relevance to the ongoing fires."
"There was enough matter and energy for a zombie fire to burn under the ice because peat is under the ice. Peat is decomposed and compressed plants that form over thousands of years to make peat. In the Paper about 11,000 years ago, we see how earths tilt was 24.5 degrees which allowed more sunlight to enter. If there is more sunlight, more photosynthesis can happen. Photosynthesis is  plants releasing oxygen from energy and light from the sun.If there is more sunlight, more plants can grow and more photosynthesis can occur. In the Leaf experament, we see how the tube with direct light had the most color change. In the burning fuel experament, we see how the Peat took a while to catch on fire, yet never creating a flame. The peat however did release smoke and embers. we see from the model how when smoke is released, it releases Carbon Dioxide. Since all this energy is stored under the ice, it is able to keep the fire burning even when its trapped under, letting it re emerge when the ice and snow melts. This shows that there was enough matter and energy for a zombie fire to burn under the ice because peat is under the ice because how the peat makes energy and stores it and releases it.","In the future there wont be as much zombie fires because permafrost and ice and snow if temperatures ccontinue to rise. If the temperature rises, the permafrost will melt and permafrost is what keeps peat underground when its cold. If there is less permafrost, the peat wll keep burning and the fires will keep raging. Since the peat has a lot of fuel, it will burn and less zombie fires will occur because there isnt as much permafrost to keep the peat and fires hidden for colder months. We can show a example of this in the model above where we see how after the fire re emerges from being frozen, it grows by 57%. If there isnt as much permafrost to freeze the peat underground, how will the fire keep happening. ",,"To enhance your response, consider organizing your answer more clearly by explicitly stating each component of the matter and energy flow. For instance, you could start by explaining how energy flows through the system from the sun to the plants through photosynthesis, and then from the peat to the zombie fire. Additionally, your explanation could benefit from a clearer connection between the class experiments and the scientific ideas they represent, such as explicitly linking the 'burning fuel experiment' to the concept of decomposition and energy release. Finally, ensure that your discussion on the impact of Earth's tilt on photosynthesis more clearly connects to how it affects the formation and persistence of peat in the Arctic.","You did a great job explaining how peat is formed and its role in zombie fires. You mentioned that 'Peat is decomposed and compressed plants that form over thousands of years to make peat,' which effectively demonstrates your understanding of the matter involved in the system. Additionally, your reference to the 'Leaf experiment' and 'burning fuel experiment' provides specific evidence from class activities, meeting the assignment criteria."
"The biggest reason as to how there is enough matter and energy for zombie fires to burn under the ice is that there was a lot of fuel in the form of Carbon Dioxide stored underneath the ice to fuel a fire and that fuel is peat. Peat is formed by dead plants sinking to the bottom of bodies of water and combining together as described in ""Peat, Permafrost, Carbon"". The reason for their even being plants in the arctic in the first place is that, according to ""Geologic Time"", about 11,000 years ago the Earth's tilt on it's axis was about 24 degrees, whereas today's Earth's tilt is about 22 degrees, causing the North and South poles to be closer to, and therefore get more light and heat from, the sun. This extra sunlight and warmth allowed for living things such as plants to be able to exist in the arctic and when these plants died, they formed peat which contains carbon and oxygen. And so because of the stockpile of peat buried under the permafrost, the fires can continue to burn, releasing the carbon and oxygen in the form of Carbon Dioxide, even while buried underneath the permafrost.","If the temperature on Earth continues to rise, then more wildfires in the Arctic will burn. There will be more fires because the reason for the high temperatures, Carbon Dioxide (CO2), serves as fuel for fires and also the extra heat will help to contribute to the fires. There will be more fires also because of the melting permafrost exposing more peat which also serves as fuel for the fires.",,"To improve your writing, consider organizing your response to more clearly delineate between the different components of the question. You can start by clearly stating your claim using the sentence starters provided, like ""Zombie fires can burn under ice because..."" This will help to structure your explanation. Additionally, further explaining how peat's composition contributes to the continuation of the fire could strengthen your connection to the concept of matter and energy transformation. Ensure that you consistently link back to how these processes allow for the continuation of zombie fires under ice, which would make your explanation even more comprehensive.","You've done a great job of incorporating specific evidence from class activities into your explanation, which is a key part of the assignment criteria. For example, you mention the class activity ""Peat, Permafrost, Carbon"" to explain how peat is formed by dead plants. You also reference the ""Geologic Time"" activity to discuss historical changes in the Earth's tilt, providing a solid scientific basis for why plants could exist in the Arctic. This demonstrates a strong understanding of the historical context and its relevance to current conditions, effectively supporting your claim about the matter and energy available for zombie fires."
"Increased energy from the sun caused matter and energy to be stored as sugar in the Peat in the Zombie Fire system. In the past, the Artic was different than today because 11,000 years ago the earth's tilt was 24.5. The greater angle of the Earth aloud the Artic to recieve a greater amount of Solar Radiation. When the Artic was getting more solar radiation that meant that there was higher ability to have more Photosynthesis. When there was a greater amount of Solar radiation and Photosynthesis it aloud more plants to grow and then die because of the cold tempututes, then turning into Peat and alowing more matter under the ice. In the Artic there is a high amount of Peat because the Artic temputures are to cold for the Peat to decompose, leaving a high amount of Peat under the ground. The contributes to the Zombie fires because the greater amount of Peat in the Artic under the Permafrost means its giving more energy for Zombie fires to form. Duirng the Yeast Lab in class, the cups represented the Artic. The yeast on the bottom of the cup represented the permafrost underground and then the foam on top represented the snow on top. When the sugar was added it was to show the Peat. The Beaker with the warm water showed the most change with the greatest amount of foam. After 8 minutes the warm beaker had 2.8 centimeters of foam. This showed that with the warmest temptutures it caused there to be more CO2 and cause more fire under ground. Today the earth's tilt is 22.1 and since it is a lesser angle than 11,000 years ago, it causes the Artic to have less solar radiation which then slows down the Photosynthesis process, which in the end leads up to a smaller amount of Peat decomposing and less energy for zombie fires to burn under the ice. During our class's expierment the Tilt lab we discovered that the test tube with the greatest amount of sugar was the tube with direct sunlight. This meant that it did the highest amount of Photosynthesis. This relates to the tilt 11,000 years ago at 24.5 degreee angle , that this was when there was the greatest amount of peat decomposing under the ice from solar radiation causing the most matter for zombie fires to start. We also found out from the lab that when there is more sunlight (input) more sugar (the output) can be made becuase more sunlight makes higher percentage of Photosynthesis. One way that energy flows into the zombie fires is by cellular respiration, when the PSN ouputs the Glucose it causes the Peat to make more energy. When the fire is around it increases temputures and then causes the permafrost to thaw. Then that causes the Peat to be exposed to oxygen and causes to fire to be bigger, because fire spreads easier when it is intaking more oxygen. Which then will cause more Co2 in the atmospehere. ",As the years go on and the world gets warmer from global warming the permafrost is going to melt which will cause the peat to be exposed to more oxygen. This will cause fire to burn greater and this then will lead to more CO2 in the atmosphere. The temputures rising will also cause a higher amount of Photsynthesis and a mass amount of Peat will then be under the ground causing the fires to start easier and spread more during the winter months while they are underground.,,"To enhance your writing, consider organizing your explanation more clearly by breaking it into distinct sections or paragraphs. Start by clearly defining how peat forms, then explain why it doesn't decompose, and finally connect these ideas to how zombie fires can sustain. Also, be sure to check for spelling errors and ensure that your writing is concise and clear. For example, ""aloud"" should be ""allowed,"" and ""temputures"" should be ""temperatures."" Additionally, make sure you explicitly state your claim about matter and energy at the start and conclude with how these contribute to zombie fires. This will help strengthen the connection between your evidence and your claims about the zombie fire system.","You've done a great job of incorporating specific evidence from class activities to support your explanation, such as the Yeast Lab where you describe the warm beaker having 2.8 centimeters of foam, showing how warmer temperatures can increase CO2 production and fire potential. Additionally, you effectively relate the Earth's historical tilt to increased solar radiation and photosynthesis, explaining how this process contributed to the accumulation of peat."
