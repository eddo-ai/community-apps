2024-11-15 14:30:39.532973,IMG_9265.jpeg,Peat Explanation,"There is a lot of peat in permafrost that has not decomposed because of temperature and oxygen exposure. Decomposition occurs because of cellular respiration, a process that breaks down matter into simple forms and releases energy. This mechanism requires warmer temperatures and higher levels of additional oxygen to work quickly. In an experiment with yeast decomposing sugar into carbon dioxide, the yeast in the warmest environment (beaker) produced more CO2 than the cold and room temperature ones. After 20 minutes, the yeast/sugar/water mixture in the warmest beaker was 4.3 cm high, while the cool and room temperature beakers were only at 2.1 cm and 3 cm respectively, showing that cellular respiration works faster at warmer temperatures. In a graph showing decomposition rates of plant matter over time, after 100 days, the plant matter with the high additional oxygen had only around 10% of its plant matter left, while the plant matter with no additional oxygen had around 60% of its plant matter left after 100 days. This represents that higher exposure to oxygen makes cellular respiration work faster. Because peat is frozen in permafrost underground, the temperatures and oxygen levels are very low, which is why peat is failing to decompose in the zombie fire system."
2024-11-15 14:30:39.538736,IMG_9266.jpeg,Peat Explanation,"There is so much peat that hasn’t decomposed while in the permafrost because in order to decompose you need energy. When the temperature is cold, there is less energy which causes slower decomposition. We saw this in the yeast lab. The warmer water had a much bigger reaction, after 14 minutes the warm beaker had risen to 11 cm this illuminates a large amount of energy was created in warmer temperatures. But in the cold water beaker it only rose to 2.5 mm after 14 minutes. This also a reaction means less energy. This data shows that the hotter the temp the more energy there is. Given that the process of decomposition needs energy, when peat is in an cold area with less energy, such as permafrost, less decomposition will take place. This is why there is so much peat that has not decomposed in permafrost."
2024-11-15 14:30:39.540954,IMG_9268.jpeg,Peat Explanation,"The peat-permafrost ecosystem is composed of peat permafrost (remnants of frozen plant matter) and CO2. During this process, peat is burned under thermodynamically zombie fires. Peat is formed by plant matter in wetlands over many years. These plants contain sugar which contains oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon. I already know from our experiment in BPL that peat can burn underground for a very long time, and releases large amounts of CO2. Because peat is a carbon sink, it traps the CO2 underground preventing it from going into the atmosphere. I also know from our test yesterday (?) that the underground bogs need more access to more oxygen, they are able to break things down faster. Over time everything up because peat burns underground for a necessary length, there is a long opportunity for cellular respiration to happen and rearrange the minerals (?) of the peat to CO2, then eventually CO2 is created because of the high temperatures from the peat burning. Eventually, there is enough CO2 underground because there isn't enough oxygen for peat to decompose fast enough, which is why there is still so much underground. The flow of energy and matter changes during cellular respiration when the CO2 is formed, causing a long-scale that will repeat again the next winter."
2024-11-15 14:37:01.731146,IMG_9267.jpeg,Peat Explanation,"The peat/permafrost system is composed of different aspects. First is the permafrost which is a cold layer of decomposed plants & organisms. This layer keeps the peat from decomposing. And the peat stores CO2 in the plants w/sugar & oxygen. The cellular respiration is slowed down when it's colder & there is less oxygen. All of these things are made of decomposed plants & H2O is the components of the system. The energy plays a big role in this system. First the energy is in the atmosphere. (heat) When it heats up it goes into the peat. This heat then releases it in the form of CO2. The more CO2 oxygen in the peat the easier it is to transfer into CO2 but the heat really helps the system move on. Heat causes the process to speed up & cause more energy to go into the atmosphere. In the peat investigation we see how heat affects the cellular respiration. In the cold weather the peat CO2 only lose 0.5cm, the room temperature 3.5cm & stand above the peat was the last water from other matter. It shows how the increase in heat doubles the rate of decomposition. It also causes more energy to be stored (faster) in our cellular respiration affects the flow of matter & energy by creating & carrying out the process using what it's given. We seen an experiment where the scientists out oxygen in beakers w/different levels. And they saw that the more oxygen, the more decomposition & it would go faster. The cellular respiration is used when a decomposing happens & it turns it into energy. In this case the peat is getting decomposed & it’s turning that matter & energy into CO2."
2024-11-15 15:43:07.437576,IMG_9270.jpeg,Peat Explanation,"Peat is composed of plants that have died & piled up under water in wet ecosystems like bogs & swamps. Permafrost is a solid ice that forms over the peat. The energy starts in the peat & flows through the sugar molecules to the permafrost. The matter moves from the permafrost to the peat when the permafrost melts. Cellular respiration affects the flow of energy & matter by how high the temperature is & how much oxygen. In our lab we saw that higher temperatures were able to make the sugar release more carbon dioxide when measuring, our beaker w/ the cold water/yeast/sugar mixture reached up to 4.3 cm. When measuring our beaker w/ warm water the yeast/sugar mixture reached up to 6.1 cm. This shows how higher temperatures are able to make sugar release more CO2 also meaning higher temperatures & oxygen are able to increase the flow of energy & matter."
2024-11-15 15:43:07.437578,IMG_9271.jpeg,,"There is so much peat in the perma-frost that hasn’t decomposed because the coldness of the perma-frost slows down the cellular decomposition of the peat. In the yeast investigation we saw that the sugar in the beakers reacted differently in all 3 beakers, in the warmest water the beaker grew the most starting at 15mm and finishing at 34mm. In the room temp water it started at 15mm and ended at 25mm. Finally in the cold water beaker we saw that it started at 15mm and ended at 15mm with no growth. This shows us that the cold water substantially slows down the decomposing process and that it decomposes slower in colder environments than warmer environments. My second piece of evidence comes from the oxygen and decomposition investigation. In this investigation scientist added plant matter and decomposers into a vase with water, in this vase the scientist added 4 different amounts of oxygen into each vase ranging from none to high. They then studied what would happen. They saw that the one with the most additional oxygen decomposed the fastest and the one with no additional decomposed the slowest. This relates back to our question because the permafrost blocks any and almost all oxygen to the peat causing it to have no additional oxygen making it decompose substantially slower than normal. In conclusion the peat in the permafrost doesn’t decompose because of the cold temperature of the perma-frost and the lack of oxygen to the peat."
2024-11-15 15:43:07.437578,IMG_9272.jpeg,Peat Explanation,Stores a lot of peat that has yet to decompose is compressed. This is due to high moisture an atmosphere that denies cellular respiration. Cellular respiration decomposes components in ecosystem such as peat but in class we did an experiment that found that heat rises CO2 so we will start to see more decomposition as climate change gets worse.
2024-11-15 15:43:07.437579,IMG_9273.jpeg,Peat Explanation,"Peat is composed of dead plant matter bunched together and not decomposed. permafrost is mix of rock soil, peat and ice. permafrost traps the peat in extra icy winter of ice. this makes peat unable to decompose. since it is stored with all that ice. so still when it gets burned it releases a lot of co2 from because of this burn in fall time because of new mulch and how long it had to finish. the fire can rid off of the peat, then in spring it melts through the permafrost and also can give fire the releases a lot of co2. the system of peat is made of plants, oxygen, co2 water and permafrost. cellular respiration affects that type of matter and energy by having fire turn the peat to usable energy for itself to support yeast decomposition. excel energy is the data that we collected showing less reaction in the decomposition the cover the water by."
2024-11-15 15:48:45.070684,IMG_9274.jpeg,Peat Explanation,The peat enviornment of carbon based dead plant and vegitation with lines of sugar and plantfast that prevents matter and energy from flowing calory with cellular respiration meaning matter and energy who flood so it wont decompose and it cant decomb because the permafrost is so cold. In the yeast lab the cold water was the slowest the temp was not letting energy flow so theres no bubbles.
2024-11-15 15:48:45.070689,IMG_9275.jpeg,Peat Explanation,"The peat / permafrost system is composed of hydrogen oxygen and carbon and living plants or dead the energy start in the plants live or dead and goes through soil to the peat and the matter move from peat and all the things around makes carbon peat can be used for fuel to cook food or heat homes people today still use peat today for these purposes in the arctic there is 1.3 million square km of peat land peat is used for permafrost. Permafrost is a mix of rock soil ice and peat lots of people uses peat and you can use it for a lot of different things evidence yeast lab and the work packed peat, permafrost, carbon."
2024-11-15 15:48:45.070690,IMG_9276.jpeg,Peat Explanation,"The reason why so much peat hasn't decomposed in the permafrost is that permafrost only trap/keep peat from decomposing and the only way for something to decompose it has to die and when peat is under permafrost it doesn't die because the permafrost is protecting it. Also, when the temp is higher, and the oxygen is higher it will increase decomposing. In the yeast investigation when the water was warmer the was more bubbles/more decomposition."
2024-11-15 15:48:45.070691,IMG_9277.jpeg,Peat Explanation,The peat/permafrost system is composed of carbon and sugars that are in the peat and have been trapped under the permafrost and keep their energy and don’t decompose. The way the energy flows from within is from chemical reactions. When specific components come together they may cause a chemical reaction which can make gas that goes to other systems bringing them more energy. Cellular respiration effects the flow of energy and matter by causing build ups blocking the flow.
2024-11-15 16:00:19.861895,IMG_9278.jpeg,Why is there so much peat that has not decomposed in the permafrost?,"Peat has not decomposed in the permafrost because of the cut off from oxygen and the cold temperatures, to support this in the lab we did with beakers containing warm, room temp, and cold water we found in the warm beaker just after two minutes the beakers containing sugar(yeast) an output of bubbles showed energy and CO2 given off identifying a fast rate of decomposition but also in that lab we found throughout the whole 18 minutes in the cold beaker of water no sign of decomposition or cellular respiration was exposed with no CO2/bubbles being created. During decomposition cellular respiration is the process of turning dead matter(peat) in food into useable energy and other plants. Decomposition can be exemplified through the equation yeast + C6H12O6 = 6CO2 + 6H2O + 6t+0+ATP meaning a needed input for the decomposition to occur is oxygen to create and outcome of energy and CO2 and even water, this process does not get completed as a result of the peat being trapped in/under the permafrost with little oxygen the more oxygen the faster the rate of decomposition in the graph during our thing we found during oxygen being added the rate was 0.757 per day where as with no oxygen added the rate of decomposition was only 0.259 each day."
2024-11-15 16:06:20.079780,IMG_9279.jpeg,Why is there so much peat that has not decomposed in the permafrost?,"There is so much undecomposed peat in the permafrost because the peat doesn’t get oxygen when it’s in the permafrost. The cold temperatures decrease the rate of decomposition. The peat/permafrost system is composed of sugar glucose and oxygen. The warmer temperatures increase the rate of decomposition because investigation 3 in class proved that when the water was cold (67°F), over the course of 18 minutes, there was a constant of 0 mm of bubbles when we combined water, yeast, and sugar. However, when the water was warm (144.9°F) the yeast started to have more mm of bubbles. Like at 18 minutes there was 15 mms of bubbles. This model relates how cold temperatures slow the rate of decomposition because the bacteria was the article. The yeast was the bacteria/decomposer and the sugar was the peat. The bubbles created represented carbon dioxide. More heat means more CO2 and oxygen and energy and more cold means less CO2 into energy. Oxygen is an input for cellular respiration. When oxygen is present, the glucose/peat will break down, but if there is no oxygen, the peat will not decompose in the permafrost. The oxygen & decomposition lab showed the rate plant matter went from 85% -> 60% when no oxygen was present but had a rate of 0.75 and went from 80% -> 75% when there was oxygen present shows the more oxygen the faster the rate of decomposition."
2024-11-15 16:06:20.079784,IMG_9280.jpeg,Peat Explanation,"The reason so much peat has not decomposed is, there is not much oxygen in/under the permafrost. When there is more oxygen there is more cellular respiration. Peat over the summer increased in conditions where there was an added oxygen had a decomposition rate of .25% per day. Another reason the decomposition by peat is so slow is because of the temperature. Based off the yeast decomposition investigation, the yeast in the cold water released 13 ml less of co2 than the yeast in the warm water."
2024-11-15 16:06:20.079785,IMG_9281.jpeg,Peat Explanation,"The Peat/Permafrost system is composed of cellular respiration and decomposition with glucose, carbon dioxide, and so that means that is what the Peat/Permafrost system has in it. The energy needs to have a reaction with this system and flows through the Peat/Permafrost system to be able to get a reaction from it and to make the particles in the Peat to be able to speed up with the more energy while with the less energy causes particles to be able to slow down. Cellular respiration affects the flow of matter and energy by its inputs and outputs and that would matter to see if it affects the speed that the particles are going to be able to move at. One piece of evidence I have to support my idea is that on a model we made it shows Peat/Permafrost and its system and how energy and make it slow down or speed up in order for it to be able to work and how much oxygen is needed or what goes inside of it."
2024-11-15 16:06:20.079786,IMG_9282.jpeg,Peat Explanation,"The Peat/Permafrost system is composed of sugar, oxygen, and CO2. Some of the other components are water (H2O) and energy. The interactions between them are the inputs and outputs. Inputs: sugar (glucose) oxygen (O2). Outputs are carbon dioxide (CO2) water (H2O), and energy. One example of flow could be the yeast experiment. 14 minutes in, I went to compare the room temp and warm. At 14 min the room temp beaker was at 11mm and the warm beaker was at 14mm. I feel this was important because it continues to show the beakers increasing steadily the whole entire lab. In conclusion, the peat/permafrost is created and tears through sugar, oxygen, carbon dioxide, energy, and water."
2024-11-15 16:06:20.079787,IMG_9283.jpeg,Peat Explanation,"There is so much peat that hasn't decomposed in the permafrost because of the limiting factors in the ecosystem. In the yeast data investigation the rate of change was 0.1 more bubbles per minute in the cold beaker, while the rate of change for the warm beaker was 83% more bubbles per minute. These rates of change are so different because in order for decomposition (cellular respiration) to occur, there need to be warm temperatures, the temperature is one of the limiting factors. In the oxygen and decomposition data analysis, the rate of change in the no added oxygen beaker was 25% over 100 days, whereas in the high additional added oxygen beaker was 75% over 100 days. The rate of change is so different because oxygen is a limiting factor or input needed in cellular respiration. The amount of oxygen and the temperature are two limiting factors in cellular respiration."
2024-11-15 16:06:20.079788,IMG_9284.jpeg,Peat Explanation,"Peat is a matter that forms over hundreds to thousands of years. Plants grow, die, then begin to pile onto each other in ecosystems that are wet and cold. The plant material does not decompose fully though. The chains of the sugar molecules which are made of ""carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms,"" make up the plant and stays the same as if the plant was alive. After a yeast experiment in class, connections were able to be made. The sugar stood as peat, and we studied how a change in temperature would affect the cycling of matter and flow of energy from the sugar which stood as the biosphere, to CO2 which stood as the atmosphere. During the experiment we measured the amount of carbon dioxide being released for each temperature. The cold temp. breaker had 0cm of ""foam."" The room temp breaker had the measure of 0.9cm after 20 minutes. Finally the hot temp breaker measured 2cm after 20 minutes. This connected to the peat because in a study, it was explained that warm temperatures thaws the peat, and releases carbon-containing gases such as carbon dioxide, into the atmosphere. Which was what was happening for the yeast experiment, the foam being the carbon. Another investigation was the matter-energy cards. Which explained the chemical reaction, such as: ""Sugar + oxygen yields carbon dioxide + water + energy."" The study of the chemical reaction made us realize that warmer temps makes burning faster, molecules move faster which speeds up the decomposition, which is cellular respiration."
2024-11-15 16:06:20.079788,IMG_9285.jpeg,Peat Explanation,"Peat is not a decomposer found in many places after a disaster like a zombie fire or just in normal unnamed places. If found at the sight of a recent fire, the peat is there to decompose the burned up parts of the area. Peat isn’t fully decomposed itself, so it has sugar molecules, so it burns, and those same sugar molecules give off CO2. There is a lot of peat in permafrost because permafrost isn’t fully decomposed as well. Matter and energy is released, and a lot of it at that matter. So much air is released when peat burns because there are a lot of glucose sugars left in the peat, so the peat was decomposed fast. When matter combusts, CO2 is released. Sugars have glucose, they are able to be broken down into carbon dioxide. Peat has all of these components and help with the overall decomposition process. In fact, all living organisms need oxygen to function, so the peat cannot get any ATP. Because without oxygen, the process of cellular respiration will not start. Plant matter decomposes along the peat system. Because plant matter and decomposers need different levels of additional oxygen. Peat needs energy to burn during decomposition. I mean, you don’t have to have it but, the decomposition process will be way slower."
2024-11-15 16:06:20.079789,IMG_9286.jpeg,Peat Explanation,"To explain peat easier, the main component is dead vegetation. Peat is made when plants die, and they fall into some sort of body of water, and eventually with all of the dead plant packed together peat is formed. To get more specific, there is carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen in peat. Matter gets added to this component when plants die, and adds to the pile of dead plants. Energy flows out of peat when it is burned, giving off heat and light energy. The role of cellular respiration is to turn energy from food into usable energy or from the peat to the cell when it burns. This is because the dead plants aren’t fully decomposed. Evidence from one investigation is the yeast, sugar, and water investigation we put yeast and sugar in different water temperatures. Because of cellular respiration more foam, or energy, was released, especially from the hot water."
2024-11-15 16:06:20.079790,IMG_9287.jpeg,Peat Explanation,"in the permafrost there is a lot of peat that has not decomposed because of the temperature. During our yeast lab, we had 3 different temperatures of water for the yeast to react to, cold room temp, hot. During that lab the hot reacted the most, with 0.45cm of reacted yeast at the top, the cold however didn’t react at all. This applys to the decomposition process of the peat as the permafrost is too cold for the peat to decompose. Another example of this is a food dye lab I did in 6th grade, we had a cup of cold water and a cup of hot water, put a drop of food coloring in each and found that the food dye mixed in with the hot water really fast, whereas even by the end of class, the cold water was barly mixed. This shows molecules move faster in warm temperatures, so because the peat is in extreamly cold temperatures, the molicules are moving much much slower, this means the reason there is so much peat in the permafrost is the cold temperatures making it hard for the peat to break down."
2024-11-15 16:06:20.079790,IMG_9288.jpeg,,"Why I think there's so much peat that has not decomposed in the permafrost because of the components in peat. The peat system is composed of plants and how I know this is because peat is plant matter and in year 50 of the 100 years peat only states how new plants grow, go & sink to the bottom adding to layers of peat and only decomposes slowly overtime. And there's no decomposer flow. Another reason why there's so much peat that hasn't decomposed is because of the energy flow I know is because the transport (permafrost) energy moves very slow, because of how cold it is. Slowing down the decomposition process, plants have little to no energy. In the article it states if the submerged plant material does not decompose completely. So also the plant material doesn't always decompose. Last how I know why there's so much peat in permafrost is because the mechanism. Cellular respiration affects the flow of matter & energy, there is no peat, no cellular respiration happens in the peat so it can decompose. In the yeast lab, we put yeast & sugar in the cold & room temperature and hot to see how much foam there would be. In the cold water with the yeast and sugar it took longer for foam to form because the energy in the cold water is slower than room temp & hot water. For the 24 minutes lab no foam appeared on the cold water because but if we waited longer, eventually the foam would’ve form just like how eventually peat starts to break down but it takes longer because of the cold permafrost. This is why I think there’s so much peat that hasn’t decomposed in the permafrost."
2024-11-15 16:06:20.079791,IMG_9289.jpeg,Peat Explanation,"the reason there is so much peat that hasn't decomposed in the permafrost is because the temperature negatively effects the rate of decomposition. For example, the cold water used in the yeast experiment had no change through 24 minutes starting and staying at 18 C. This shows that the yeast was only able to decompose a small amount of the sugar. Peat also is able to survive at low oxygen. This was shown in the burning video where peat was the only subject to burn substantially going from 0.4g to 0.0g over 10 mins. This shows that peat can still function at low oxygen levels since it was unable to burn while covered. In the case of permafrost, peat is trapped underground where there is less oxygen therefore decomposition becomes slower because oxygen is a main component of cellular respiration."
2024-11-15 16:06:20.079791,IMG_9290.jpeg,Peat Explanation,"In the peat and permafrost system, this is composed of plants, water, peat, and animals. The flow of energy starts at animals which eventually die, giving energy to plants. Plants die as well and their vegetation falls into nearby swamps and bogs. This vegetation is called peat. Peat collects in layers over hundreds or thousands of years but never decomposes fully. In a recent experiment, scientists found that plant matter with no oxygen decomposes 50% slower than plant matter with higher levels of oxygen. Because water has 20% less oxygen than air, it's harder for plants to decompose. During their in-depth experiment, they found that cellular respiration was completely stopped in cold temperatures. But in warmer temperatures, it increased. So, during the summer."
2024-11-15 16:09:52.889822,IMG_9269.jpeg,Peat Explanation,"There is so much peat that has not decomposed in the ground, but this is because there is no oxygen in for many reasons. First, matter needs oxygen to decompose. Scientists induced four different jars filled with plant matter & decomposers, each jar had a different level of oxygen. When left to decompose, jars with less or no oxygen decompose faster than jars with more oxygen. Peat is formed in water, which has less oxygen and is the weight that is covered by snow, because there is so little oxygen, the peat doesn't fully decompose. Next, we had three jars with yeast sugar and water, all at different temperatures. When the yeast was added, we measured which released more CO2 because the jar with warm water released more CO2. Temperature affects the rate of cellular respiration. In the system, during the winter it is very cold so cellular respiration can't happen and the peat doesn't decompose."
