# L6 Zombie Fire Explanation

Summative To study changing fires in the Arctic, scientists took pictures of fires from space, using special cameras. The first image (top-left), acquired in September 2015, shows the burn scar from the Soda Creek Fire, which scorched nearly 17,000 acres in southwest Alaska near the Kuskokwim River. The fire was never completely extinguished before winter set in. In April 2016 (top-right), the fire continued to smolder in the peat under a layer of snow. When the snow finally melted in late May (bottom-left), the additional heat and oxygen caused flames to re-emerge and quickly spread.

| Instructions: Use evidence from your investigations in class to explain both questions below:    (A) How was there enough matter and energy in the system for a zombie fire to burn under ice?    (B) What will happen in the future if temperatures continue to rise? |  |
